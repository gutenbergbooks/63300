<h2><span class="small">INTRODUCTION.</span></h2>
<p>When it is considered that Pythagoras was the
father of philosophy, authentic memoirs of his life
cannot fail to be uncommonly interesting to every
lover of wisdom, and particularly to those who reverence
the doctrines of Plato, the most genuine and
the best of all his disciples. And that the following
memoirs of Pythagoras by Iamblichus are authentic,
is acknowledged by all the critics, as they
are for the most part obviously derived from
<span class="pb" id="Page_vi">vi</span>
sources of very high antiquity; and where the
sources are unknown, there is every reason to believe,
from the great worth and respectability of
the biographer, that the information is perfectly
accurate and true.</p>
<p>Of the biographer, indeed, Iamblichus, it is well
known to every tyro in Platonism that he was dignified
by all the Platonists that succeeded him with
the epithet of <i>divine</i>; and after the encomium
passed on him by the acute Emperor Julian, &ldquo;<i>that
he was posterior indeed in time, but not in genius,
to Plato</i>,&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a> all further praise of him would be as
<span class="pb" id="Page_vii">vii</span>
unnecessary, as the defamation of him by certain
modern critics is contemptible and idle. For these
<i>homonculi</i> looking solely to his deficiency in point
of style, and not to the magnitude of his intellect,
perceive only his little blemishes, but have not
even a glimpse of his surpassing excellence. They
minutely notice the motes that are scattered in the
sunbeams of his genius, but they feel not its invigorating
warmth, they see not its dazzling radiance.</p>
<p>Of this very extraordinary man there is a life
extant by Eunapius, the substance of which I have
given in my History of the Restoration of the Platonic
Theology, and to which I refer the English
reader. At present I shall only select from that
work the following biographical particulars respecting
our Iamblichus: He was descended of a
<span class="pb" id="Page_viii">viii</span>
family equally illustrious, fortunate, and rich. His
country was Chalcis, a city of Syria, which was
called C&oelig;le. He associated with Anatolius who
was the second to Porphyry, but he far excelled
him in his attainments, and ascended to the very
summit of philosophy. But after he had been for
some time connected with Anatolius, and most probably
found him insufficient to satisfy the vast desires
of his soul, he applied himself to Porphyry,
to whom (says Eunapius) he was in nothing inferior,
except in the structure and power of composition.
For his writings were not so elegant and
graceful as those of Porphyry: they were neither
agreeable, nor perspicuous; nor free from impurity
of diction. And though they were not entirely
involved in obscurity, and perfectly faulty;
yet as Plato formerly said of Xenocrates, he did
not sacrifice to the <i>Mercurial Graces</i>. Hence he
<span class="pb" id="Page_ix">ix</span>
is far from detaining the reader with delight, who
merely regards his diction; but will rather avert
and dull his attention, and frustrate his expectation.
However, though the surface of his conceptions is
not covered with the flowers of elocution, yet the
depth of them is admirable, and his genius is truly
sublime. And admitting his style to abound in
general with those defects, which have been noticed
by the critics, yet it appears to me that the decision
of the anonymous Greek writer respecting his
Answer to the Epistle of Porphyry,<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a> is more or
less applicable to all his other works. For he says,
&lsquo;that his diction in that Answer is concise and
definite, and that his conceptions are full of efficacy,
are elegant, and divine.&rsquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_3" href="#fn_3">[3]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_x">x</div>
<p>Iamblichus shared in an eminent degree the favor
of divinity, on account of his cultivation of
justice; and obtained a numerous multitude of
associates and disciples, who came from all parts
of the world, for the purpose of participating the
streams of wisdom, which so plentifully flowed from
the sacred fountain of his wonderful mind.
Among these was Sopater the Syrian,<a class="fn" id="fr_4" href="#fn_4">[4]</a> who was
most skilful both in speaking and writing; Eustathius
the Cappadocian; and of the Greeks, Theodorus
and Euphrasius. All these were excellent
for their virtues and attainments, as well as many
other of his disciples, who were not much inferior
<span class="pb" id="Page_xi">xi</span>
to the former in eloquence; so that it seems wonderful
how Iamblichus could attend to all of them,
with such gentleness of manners and benignity of
disposition as he continually displayed.</p>
<p>He performed some few particulars relative to
the veneration of divinity by himself, without his
associates and disciples; but was inseparable from
his familiars in most of his operations. He imitated
in his diet the frugal simplicity of the most
ancient times; and during his repast, exhilarated
those who were present by his behaviour, and
filled them as with nectar by the sweetness of his
discourse.</p>
<p>A celebrated philosopher named Alypius, who
was deeply skilled in dialectic, was contemporary
with Iamblichus, but was of such a diminutive stature,
<span class="pb" id="Page_xii">xii</span>
that he exhibited the appearance of a pigmy.
However, his great abilities amply compensated for
this trifling defect. For his body might be said to be
consumed into soul; just as the great Plato says,
that divine bodies, unlike those that are mortal,
are situated in souls. Thus also it might be asserted
of Alypius, that he had migrated into soul,
and that he was contained and governed by a
nature superior to man. This Alypius had many
followers, but his mode of philosophizing was confined
to private conference and disputation, without
committing any of his dogmas to writing. Hence
his disciples gladly applied themselves to Iamblichus,
desirous to draw abundantly from the exuberant
streams of his inexhaustible mind. The fame
therefore of each continually increasing, they once
accidentally met like two refulgent stars, and were
surrounded by so great a crowd of auditors, that it
<span class="pb" id="Page_xiii">xiii</span>
resembled some mighty mus&aelig;um. While Iamblichus
on this occasion waited rather to be interrogated,
than to propose a question himself, Alypius,
contrary to the expectation of every one, relinquishing
philosophical discussions, and seeing himself
surrounded with a theatre of men, turned to
Iamblichus, and said to him: &ldquo;Tell me, O philosopher,
is either the rich man unjust, or the heir of
the unjust man? For in this case there is no
medium.&rdquo; But Iamblichus hating the acuteness of
the question, replied: &ldquo;O most wonderful of all
men, this manner of considering, whether some one
excels in externals, is foreign from our method of
philosophizing; since we inquire whether a man
abounds in the virtue which it is proper for him to
possess, and which is adapted to a philosopher.&rdquo;
After he had said this he departed, and at the same
time all the surrounding multitude was immediately
<span class="pb" id="Page_xiv">xiv</span>
dispersed. But Iamblichus, when he was
alone, admired the acuteness of the question, and
often privately resorted to Alypius, whom he very
much applauded for his acumen and sagacity; so
that after his decease, he wrote his life. This
Alypius was an Alexandrian by birth, and died in
his own country, worn out with age: and after him
Iamblichus,<a class="fn" id="fr_5" href="#fn_5">[5]</a> leaving behind him many roots and
fountains of philosophy; which through the cultivation
of succeeding Platonists, produced a fair
variety of vigorous branches, and copious streams.</p>
<p>For an account of the theological writings of
Iamblichus, I refer the reader to my above-mentioned
<span class="pb" id="Page_xv">xv</span>
History of the Restoration of the Platonic
Theology; and for accurate critical information
concerning all his works, to the Bibliotheca Gr&aelig;ca
of Fabricius.</p>
<p>Of the following work, the life of Pythagoras, it
is necessary to observe that the original has been
transmitted to us in a very imperfect state, partly
from the numerous verbal errors of the text, partly
from the want of connexion in the things that are
narrated, and partly from many particulars being
related in different places, in the very same words;
so that the conjecture of Kuster, one of the German
editors of this work is highly probable, that it
had not received the last hand of Iamblichus, but
that others formed this treatise from the confused
materials which they found among his Manuscripts,
after his death. Notwithstanding all its defects,
<span class="pb" id="Page_xvi">xvi</span>
however, it is, as I have before observed, a most interesting
work; and the benefits are inestimable,
which the dissemination of it is calculated to produce.
And as two of the most celebrated critics
among the Germans, Kuster and Kiessling, have
given two splendid editions of this work, it is evident
they must have been deeply impressed with a
conviction of its value and importance.</p>
<p>As to the Pythagoric Ethical Fragments, all
eulogy of them is superfluous, when it is considered
that, independently of their being written by very
early Pythagoreans, they were some of the sources
from which Aristotle himself derived his consummate
knowledge of morality, as will be at once evident
by comparing his Nicomachean Ethics with
these fragments.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_xvii">xvii</div>
<p>With respect to the collection of Pythagoric
Sentences in this volume, it is almost needless to
observe that they are incomparably excellent; and
it is deeply to be regretted that the Greek original
of the Sentences of Sextus<a class="fn" id="fr_6" href="#fn_6">[6]</a> being lost, the fraudulent
Latin version of them by the Presbyter Ruffinus
alone remains. I call it a fraudulent version,
because Ruffinus, wishing to persuade the reader
that these Sentences were written by a
bishop of the name of Sixtus, has in many places
perverted and contaminated the meaning of the
original. In the selection, however, which I
have made from these Sentences, I have endeavoured,
and I trust not in vain, to give the genuine
<span class="pb" id="Page_xviii">xviii</span>
sense of Sextus, unmingled with the barbarous and
polluted interpolations of Ruffinus. If the English
reader has my translation of the Sentences of Demophilus,
and Mr. <span class="sc">Bridgman</span>&rsquo;s translation of the
Golden Sentences of Democrates, and the Similitudes
of Demophilus,<a class="fn" id="fr_7" href="#fn_7">[7]</a> he will then be possessed of
all the Pythagoric Sentences that are extant, those
alone of Sextus excepted, which I have not translated,
in consequence of the very impure and spurious
state, in which they at present exist.</p>
<p>I deem it also requisite to observe, that the Pythagoric
life which is here delineated, is a specimen
of the greatest perfection in virtue and wisdom,
<span class="pb" id="Page_xix">xix</span>
which can be obtained by man in the present state.
Hence, it exhibits piety unadulterated with folly,
moral virtue uncontaminated with vice, science
unmingled with sophistry, dignity of mind and
manners unaccompanied with pride, a sublime
magnificence in theory, without any degradation in
practice, and a vigor of intellect, which elevates
its possessor to the vision of divinity, and thus
deifies while it exalts.</p>
<p>The original of the engraving of the head of
Iamblichus in the title-page, is to be found at the
end of a little volume consisting of Latin translations
of Iamblichus De Mysteriis, Proclus On the
First Alcibiades of Plato, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. 18mo.
Genev. 1607. This engraving was added because
it appeared to me to be probable that the original
<span class="pb" id="Page_xx">xx</span>
was copied from an ancient gem. And as it is
not impossible that it was, if it is not genuine, it is
at least ornamental.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_1">1</div>
<h2><span class="small">THE LIFE,</span>
<br /><i>&amp;c.</i></h2>
<h3 id="c1">CHAP. I.</h3>
<p>Since it is usual with all men of sound understandings,
to call on divinity, when entering on any
philosophic discussion, it is certainly much more
appropriate to do this in the consideration of that
philosophy which justly receives its denomination
from the divine Pythagoras. For as it derives its
origin from the Gods, it cannot be apprehended
without their inspiring aid. To which we may
also add, that the beauty and magnitude of it so
greatly surpasses human power, that it is impossible
to survey it by a sudden view; but then alone
can any one gradually collect some portion of this
philosophy, when, the Gods being his leaders, he
quietly approaches to it. On all these accounts,
therefore, having invoked the Gods as our leaders,
and converting both ourselves and our discussion
to them, we shall acquiesce in whatever they may
command us to do. We shall not, however, make
any apology for this sect having been neglected for
a long time, nor for its being concealed by foreign
disciplines, and certain arcane symbols, nor for
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
having been obscured by false and spurious writings,
nor for many other such-like difficulties by which
it has been impeded. For the will of the Gods is
sufficient for us, in conjunction with which it is
possible to sustain things still more arduous than
these. But after the Gods, we shall unite ourselves
as to a leader, to the prince and father
of this divine philosophy; of whose origin and
country we must rise a little higher in our investigation.</p>
<h3 id="c2">CHAP. II.</h3>
<p>It is said, therefore, that Anc&aelig;us who dwelt in
Samos in Cephallenia, was begot by Jupiter, whether
he derived the fame of such an honorable
descent through virtue, or through a certain greatness
of soul. He surpassed, however, the rest of
the Cephallenians in wisdom and renown. This
Anc&aelig;us, therefore, was ordered by the Pythian
oracle to form a colony from Arcadia and Thessaly;
and that besides this, taking with him some of the
inhabitants of Athens, Epidaurus, and Chalcis, and
placing himself at their head, he should render an
island habitable, which from the virtue of the soil
and land should be called Melamphyllos;<a class="fn" id="fr_8" href="#fn_8">[8]</a> and
that he should call the city Samos, on account of
<span class="pb" id="Page_3">3</span>
Same in Cephallenia. The oracle, therefore, which
was given to him, was as follows: &ldquo;I order you,
Anc&aelig;us, to colonise the marine island Samos instead
of Same, and to call it Phyllas.&rdquo; But that a
colony was collected from these places, is not only
indicated by the honors and sacrifices of the Gods,
transferred into those regions together with the inhabitants,
but also by the kindred families that
dwell there, and the associations of the Samians
with each other.</p>
<p>It is said, therefore, that Mnesarchus and Pytha&iuml;s,
who were the parents of Pythagoras, descended
from the family and alliance of this Anc&aelig;us,
who founded the colony. In consequence,
however, of this nobility of birth being celebrated
by the citizens, a certain Samian poet says, that
Pythagoras was the son of Apollo. For thus he
sings,</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Pytha&iuml;s, fairest of the Samian tribe,</p>
<p class="t0">Bore from th&rsquo;embraces of the God of day</p>
<p class="t0">Renown&rsquo;d Pythagoras, the friend of Jove.</p>
</div>
<p>It is worth while, however, to relate how this report
became so prevalent. The Pythian oracle
then had predicted to this Mnesarchus (who came
to Delphi for the purposes of merchandize, with
his wife not yet apparently pregnant, and who inquired
of the God concerning the event of his
voyage to Syria) that his voyage would be lucrative
and most conformable to his wishes, but that his
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
wife was now pregnant, and would bring forth a
son surpassing in beauty and wisdom all that ever
lived, and who would be of the greatest advantage
to the human race in every thing pertaining to the
life of man. But, when Mnesarchus considered
with himself, that the God, without being interrogated
concerning his son, had informed him by an
oracle, that he would possess an illustrious prerogative,
and a gift truly divine, he immediately
named his wife Pytha&iuml;s, from her son and the Delphic
prophet, instead of Parthenis, which was her
former appellation; and he called the infant, who
was soon after born at Sidon in Ph&oelig;nicia, Pythagoras;
signifying by this appellation, that such an
offspring was predicted to him by the Pythian
Apollo. For we must not regard the assertions of
Epimenides, Eudoxus, and Xenocrates, who suspect
that Apollo at that time, becoming connected
with Parthenis, and causing her to be pregnant
from not being so, had in consequence of this predicted
concerning Pythagoras, by the Delphic prophet:
for this is by no means to be admitted.<a class="fn" id="fr_9" href="#fn_9">[9]</a>
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
Indeed, no one can doubt that the soul of Pythagoras
was sent to mankind from the empire of
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
Apollo, either being an attendant on the God, of
co-arranged with him in some other more familiar
way: for this may be inferred both from his birth,
and the all-various wisdom of his soul. And thus
much concerning the nativity of Pythagoras.</p>
<p>But after his father Mnesarchus had returned
from Syria to Samos, with great wealth, which he
had collected from a prosperous navigation, he
built a temple to Apollo, with the inscription of
Pythius; and took care to have his son nourished
with various and the best disciplines, at one time
by Creophilus, at another by Pherecydes the Syrian,
and at another by almost all those who presided
over sacred concerns, to whom he earnestly recommended
Pythagoras, that he might be as much as
possible sufficiently instructed in divine concerns.
He, however, was educated in such a manner, as to
be fortunately the most beautiful and godlike of all
those that have been celebrated in the annals of
history. On the death of his father, likewise,
though he was still but a youth, his aspect was
most venerable, and his habits most temperate, so
that he was even reverenced and honored by elderly
men; and converted the attention of all who saw
and heard him speak, on himself, and appeared to
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
be an admirable person to every one who beheld
him. Hence it was reasonably asserted by many,
that he was the son of a God. But he being corroborated
by renown of this kind, by the education
which he had received from his infancy, and by his
natural deiform appearance, in a still greater degree
evinced that he deserved his present prerogatives.
He was also adorned by piety and disciplines,
by a mode of living transcendency good, by
firmness of soul, and by a body in due subjection
to the mandates of reason. In all his words and
actions, he discovered an inimitable quiet and serenity,
not being subdued at any time by anger, or
laughter, or emulation, or contention, or any other
perturbation or precipitation of conduct; but he
dwelt at Samos like some beneficent d&aelig;mon.
Hence, while he was yet a youth, his great renown
having reached Thales at Miletus, and Bias at
Priene, men illustrious for their wisdom, it also
extended to the neighbouring cities. To all which
we may add, that the youth was every where celebrated
as the <i>long-haired Samian</i>, and was reverenced
by the multitude as one under the influence
of divine inspiration. But after he had attained
the eighteenth year of his age, about the period
when the tyranny of Policrates first made its appearance,
foreseeing that under such a government
he might receive some impediment in his studies,
which engrossed the whole of his attention, he departed
privately by night with one Hermodamas
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
(whose surname was Creophilus, and who was the
grandson of him who had formerly been the host,
friend, and preceptor in all things of Homer the
poet,) to Pherecydes, to Anaximander the natural
philosopher, and to Thales at Miletus. He likewise
alternately associated with each of these philosophers,
in such a manner, that they all loved
him, admired his natural endowments, and made
him a partaker of their doctrines. Indeed, after
Thales had gladly admitted him to his intimate
confidence, he admired the great difference between
him and other young men, whom Pythagoras left
far behind in every accomplishment. And besides
this, Thales increased the reputation Pythagoras
had already acquired, by communicating to him
such disciplines as he was able to impart: and,
apologizing for his old age, and the imbecility of
his body, he exhorted him to sail into Egypt, and
associate with the Memphian and Diospolitan<a class="fn" id="fr_10" href="#fn_10">[10]</a>
priests. For he confessed that his own reputation
for wisdom, was derived from the instructions of
these priests; but that he was neither naturally,
nor by exercise, endued with those excellent prerogatives,
which were so visibly displayed in the person
of Pythagoras. Thales, therefore, gladly announced
to him, from all these circumstances, that
he would become the wisest and most divine of all
men, if he associated with these Egyptian priests.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<h3 id="c3">CHAP. III.</h3>
<p>Pythagoras, therefore, having been benefited
by Thales in other respects, and especially having
learned from him to be sparing of his time; for
the sake of this he entirely abstained from wine
and animal food, and still prior to these from
voracity, and confined himself to such nutriment
as was slender and easy of digestion. In consequence
of this, his sleep was short, his soul vigilant
and pure, and his body confirmed in a state
of perfect and invariable health. In possession of
such advantages, therefore, he sailed to Sidon,
being persuaded that this was his natural country,
and also properly conceiving that he might easily
pass from thence into Egypt. Here he conversed
with the prophets who were the descendants of
Mochus the physiologist, and with others, and
also with the Ph&oelig;nician hierophants. He was
likewise initiated in all the mysteries of Byblus
and Tyre, and in the sacred operations which are
performed in many parts of Syria; not engaging
in a thing of this kind for the sake of superstition,
as some one may be led to suppose, but much
rather from a love and desire of contemplation,
and from an anxiety that nothing might escape his
observation which deserved to be learnt in the
arcana or mysteries of the Gods. Having been
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
previously instructed therefore in the mysteries of
the Ph&oelig;nicians, which were derived like a colony
and a progeny from the sacred rites in Egypt, and
hoping from this circumstance that he should be a
partaker of more beautiful, divine, and genuine
monuments of erudition in Egypt; joyfully calling
to mind also the admonitions of his preceptor
Thales, he immediately embarked for Egypt,
through the means of some Egyptian sailors, who
very opportunely at that time landed on the
Ph&oelig;nician coast under mount Carmelus, in whose
temple Pythagoras, separated from all society, for
the most part dwelt. But the sailors gladly received
him, foreseeing that they should acquire
great gain by exposing him to sale. But when,
during the voyage, they perceived with what continence
and venerable gravity he conducted himself,
in conformity to the mode of living he had
adopted, they were more benevolently disposed
towards him. Observing, likewise, that there was
something greater than what pertains to human
nature in the modesty of the youth, they called to
mind how unexpectedly he had appeared to them
on their landing, when from the summit of mount
Carmelus, which they knew was more sacred than
other mountains, and inaccessible to the vulgar,
he leisurely descended without looking back, or
suffering any delay from precipices or opposing
stones; and that when he came to the boat, he
said nothing more than, &ldquo;Are you bound for
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
Egypt?&rdquo; And farther, that on their answering in
the affirmative, he ascended the ship and sate
silent the whole time of the voyage, in that part
of the vessel where he was not likely to incommode
the occupations of the sailors. But Pythagoras
remained in one and the same unmoved
state for two nights and three days, neither partaking
of food, nor drink, nor sleep, unless perhaps
as he sate in that firm and tranquil condition,
he might sleep for a short time unobserved by all
the sailors. To which we may add, that when the
sailors considered how, contrary to their expectations,
their voyage had been continued and uninterrupted,
as if some deity had been present;
putting all these things together, they concluded
that a divine d&aelig;mon had in reality passed over
with them from Syria into Egypt. Hence, speaking
both to Pythagoras and to each other with
greater decorum and gentleness than before, they
completed, through a most tranquil sea, the remainder
of their voyage, and at length happily
landed on the Egyptian coast. Here the sailors
reverently assisted him in descending from the
ship; and after they had placed him on the purest
sand, they raised a certain temporary altar before
him, and heaping on it from their present abundance
the fruits of trees, and presenting him as it
were with the first fruits of their freight, they
departed from thence, and hastened to their destined
port. But Pythagoras, whose body through
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
such long fasting was become weaker, did not
oppose the sailors in assisting him to descend from
the ship, and immediately on their departure eat
as much of the fruits as was requisite to restore his
decayed strength. From thence also he arrived
safe at the neighbouring lands, constantly preserving
the same tranquillity and modesty of
behaviour.</p>
<h3 id="c4">CHAP. IV.</h3>
<p>But here, while he frequented all the Egyptian
temples with the greatest diligence and with accurate
investigation, he was both admired and loved
by the priests and prophets with whom he associated.
And having learnt with the greatest solicitude
every particular, he did not neglect to hear
of any transaction that was celebrated in his own
time, or of any man famous for his wisdom, or
any mystery in whatever manner it might be performed;
nor did he omit to visit any place in
which he thought something more excellent might
be found. On this account he went to all the
priests, by whom he was furnished with the wisdom
which each possessed. He spent therefore two
and twenty years in Egypt, in the adyta of temples,
astronomizing and geometrizing, and was
initiated, not in a superficial or casual manner, in
all the mysteries of the Gods, till at length being
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
taken captive by the soldiers of Cambyses, he was
brought to Babylon. Here he gladly associated
with the Magi, was instructed by them in their
venerable knowledge, and learnt from them the
most perfect worship of the Gods. Through
their assistance likewise, he arrived at the summit
of arithmetic, music, and other disciplines; and
after associating with them twelve years, he returned
to Samos about the fifty-sixth year of his
age.</p>
<h3 id="c5">CHAP. V.</h3>
<p>On his return to Samos, however, being known by
some of the more aged inhabitants, he was not less
admired than before. For he appeared to them to
be more beautiful and wise, and to possess a divine
gracefulness in a more eminent degree. Hence,
he was publicly called upon by his country to
benefit all men, by imparting to them what he
knew. Nor was he averse to this request, but
endeavoured to introduce the symbolical mode of
teaching, in a way perfectly similar to the documents
by which he had been instructed in Egypt;
though the Samians did not very much admit this
mode of tuition, and did not adhere to him with
that according aptitude which was requisite.
Though no one therefore attended to him, and no
one was genuinely desirous of those disciplines
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
which he endeavoured by all means to introduce
among the Greeks, yet he neither despised nor
neglected Samos, because it was his country, and
therefore wished to give his fellow-citizens a taste
of the sweetness of the mathematical disciplines,
though they were unwilling to be instructed in
them. With a view to this, therefore, he employed
the following method and artifice. Happening to
observe a certain youth, who was a great lover of
gymnastic and other corporeal exercises, but otherwise
poor and in difficult circumstances, playing at
ball in the Gymnasium with great aptness and
facility, he thought the young man might easily
be persuaded to attend to him, if he was sufficiently
supplied with the necessaries of life, and
freed from the care of procuring them. As soon
as the youth, therefore, left the bath, Pythagoras
called him to him, and promised that he would
furnish him with every thing requisite to the support
of his bodily exercise, on condition that he
would receive from him gradually and easily, but
continually, so that he might not be burthened by
receiving them at once, certain disciplines, which
he said he had learnt from the Barbarians in his
youth, but which now began to desert him through
forgetfulness and the incursions of old age. But
the young man immediately acceded to the conditions,
through the hope of having necessary support.
Pythagoras, therefore, endeavoured to instruct
him in the disciplines of arithmetic and geometry,
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
forming each of his demonstrations in an
abacus, and giving the youth three oboli as a
reward for every figure which he learnt. This also
he continued to do for a long time, exciting him to
the geometrical theory by the desire of honour;
diligently, and in the best order, giving him (as we
have said) three oboli for every figure which he
apprehended. But when the wise man observed
that the elegance, sweetness, and connexion of
these disciplines, to which the youth had been led
in a certain orderly path, had so captivated him
that he would not neglect their pursuit though he
should suffer the extremity of want, he pretended
poverty, and an inability of giving him three oboli
any longer. But the youth on hearing this replied,
&ldquo;I am able without these to learn and receive
your disciplines.&rdquo; Pythagoras then said, &ldquo;But I
have not the means of procuring sufficient nutriment
for myself.&rdquo; As it is requisite, therefore, to
labour in order to procure daily necessaries and
mortal food, it would not be proper that his attention
should be distracted by the abacus, and by
stupid and vain pursuits. The youth, however,
vehemently abhorring the thought of discontinuing
his studies, replied: &ldquo;I will in future provide for
you, and repay your kindness in a way resembling
that of the stork: for I in my turn will give you
three oboli for every figure.&rdquo; And from this time
he was so captivated by these disciplines, that
he alone, of all the Samians, migrated from his
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
country with Pythagoras, having the same name
with him, but being the son of Eratocles. There
are said to be three books of this Samian On Athletics,
in which he orders the Athlet&aelig; to feed on flesh
instead of dry figs; which books are very improperly
ascribed by some to Pythagoras the son of
Mnesarchus. It is likewise said, that about the
same time Pythagoras was admired at Delos, when
he approached to the bloodless altar, as it is called,
of the father Apollo, and worshipped it. After
which he went to all the oracles. He likewise
dwelt for some time in Crete and Sparta, for the
purpose of becoming acquainted with their laws;
and, having been an auditor and learner of all
these, he returned home in order to investigate
what he had omitted. And in the first place,
indeed, he established a school in the city, which
is even now called the semicircle of Pythagoras;
and in which the Samians now consult about
public affairs, conceiving it right to investigate
things just and advantageous in that place which
he had constructed who paid attention to the
welfare of all men. He also formed a cavern out
of the city, adapted to his philosophy, in which he
spent the greatest part both of the day and night;
employing himself in the investigation of things
useful in disciplines, framing intellectual conceptions
after the same manner as Minos the son of
Jupiter. Indeed, he so much surpassed those
who afterwards employed his disciplines, that they
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
conceived magnificently of themselves, from the
knowledge of theorems of small importance; but
Pythagoras gave completion to the science of the
celestial orbs, and unfolded the whole of it by
arithmetical and geometrical demonstrations. He
is, however, to be admired in a still greater degree
for what he afterwards accomplished. For when
now philosophy had received a great accession, he
was admired by all Greece, and the best of those
who philosophized came to Samos on his account,
in order that they might participate of his erudition.
The citizens likewise employed him in all their
embassies, and compelled him to unite with them
in the administration of public affairs. However,
as he easily saw the difficulty of complying with
the laws of his country, and at the same time
remaining at home and philosophizing, and considered
that all philosophers before him had passed
their life in foreign countries, he determined to
neglect all political occupations; induced to this,
according to the testimony of others, by the negligence
of the Samians in what relates to education,
and went into Italy, conceiving that place to be
his proper country, in which men well disposed
towards learning were to be found in the greatest
abundance. And such was the success of his
journey, that on his arrival at Crotona, which was
the noblest city in Italy, he had many followers,
amounting, as it is said, to the number of six
hundred, who were not only excited by his discourses
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
to the study of philosophy, but also to an
amicable division of the goods of life in common;
from whence they acquired the appellation of
<i>C&oelig;nobit&aelig;</i>.</p>
<h3 id="c6">CHAP. VI.</h3>
<p>And these indeed were such as philosophized.
But the greatest part of his disciples consisted of
auditors whom they call <i>Acusmatici</i>, who on his
first arrival in Italy, according to Nicomachus,
being captivated by one popular oration alone,
exceeded two thousand in number. These, with
their wives and children, being collected into one
very large and common auditory, called Homaco&iuml;on,
and which for its magnitude resembled a city,
founded a place which was universally called
Magna Gr&aelig;cia. This great multitude of people
likewise, receiving laws and mandates from Pythagoras
as so many divine precepts, and without
which they engaged in no occupation, dwelt together
with the greatest general concord, celebrated
and ranked by their neighbours among the number
of the blessed. At the same time, as we have
already observed, they shared their possessions in
common. Such also was their reverence for Pythagoras,
that they numbered him with the Gods,
as a certain beneficent and most philanthropic
d&aelig;mon. And some indeed celebrated him as
the Pythian, but others as the Hyperborean Apollo.
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
Some again considered him as P&aelig;on, but others
as one of the d&aelig;mons that inhabit the moon;
and others celebrated him as one of the Olympian
Gods,<a class="fn" id="fr_11" href="#fn_11">[11]</a> who, in order to benefit and correct
the mortal life, appeared to the men of
those times in a human form, in order that he
might extend to them the salutary light of felicity
and philosophy. And indeed a greater good never
came, nor ever will come to mankind, than that
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
which was imparted by the Gods through this
Pythagoras. Hence, even now the proverb of
<i>the long-haired Samian</i>, is applied to the most
venerable man. But Aristotle relates, in his
Treatise On the Pythagoric Philosophy, that such
a division as the following was preserved by the
Pythagoreans among their principal arcana; viz.
that of rational animals one kind is a God, another
man, and another such as Pythagoras. And
indeed they very reasonably apprehended him
to be a being of this kind, through whom a right
conception and conformable to things themselves
was introduced of Gods, heroes, and d&aelig;mons; of
the world, the all-various motion of the spheres
and stars, their oppositions, eclipses, and inequalities,
their eccentricities and epicycles; of all the
natures contained in the heavens and the earth,
together with those that have an intermediate subsistence,
whether apparent or occult. Nor was
there anything (in all this variety of information)
at all contrary to the phenomena, or the conceptions
of intellect. To which we may add, that all
such disciplines, theories, and scientific investigations,
as truly invigorate the eye of the soul,
and purify the intellect from the blindness introduced
by studies of a different kind, so as to
enable it to perceive the true principles and causes
of the universe, were unfolded by Pythagoras to
the Greeks. But besides all this, the best polity,
popular concord, community of possessions among
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
friends, the worship of the gods, piety to the dead,
legislation, erudition, silence, abstinence from animals,
continence, temperance, sagacity, divinity,
and in one word, whatever is anxiously sought
after by the lovers of learning, was brought to
light by Pythagoras. On all these accounts, therefore,
as I have just now said, he was (every where)
so transcendently admired.</p>
<h3 id="c7">CHAP. VII.</h3>
<p>It remains therefore after this, that we should
relate how he travelled, what places he first visited,
what discourses he made, on what subjects, and to
whom they were addressed; for thus we shall
easily apprehend the nature of his association with
the men of that time. It is said then, that as soon
as he came to Italy and Sicily, which cities he understood
had oppressed each other with slavery,
partly at some distant period of past time, and
partly at a recent period, he inspired the inhabitants
with a love of liberty, and through the
means of his auditors, restored to independence
and liberated Crotona, Sybaris, Catanes, Rhegium,
Him&aelig;ra, Agrigentum, Tauromenas, and some
other cities, for whom also he established laws,
through Charondas the Catan&aelig;an, and Zaleucus
the Locrian, by whom they became florishing
cities, and afforded an example worthy of imitation,
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
for a long time, to the neighbouring kingdoms. He
also entirely subverted sedition, discord, and party
zeal, not only from his familiars, and their posterity,
for many generations, as we are informed by history,
but, in short, from all the cities in Italy and
Sicily, which were at that time disturbed with intestine
and external contentions. For the following
apothegm was always employed by him in every
place, whether in the company of a multitude or a
few, which was similar to the persuasive oracle of
a God, and was an epitome and summary as it
were of his own opinions; that we should avoid
and amputate by every possible artifice, by fire and
sword, and all-various contrivances, from the body,
disease; from the soul, ignorance; from the belly,
luxury; from a city, sedition; from a house, discord;
and at the same time, from all things, immoderation:
through which, with a most fatherly
affection, he reminded each of his disciples of the
most excellent dogmas. Such therefore was the
common form of his life at that time, both in words
and actions. If, however, it be requisite to make a
more particular relation of what he did and said, it
must be observed, that he came to Italy in the
sixty-second Olympiad, at which time Eryxidas of
Chalcis conquered in the stadium. But immediately
on his arrival he became conspicuous and
illustrious, in the same manner as before, when he
sailed to Delos. For there, when he performed
his adorations at the bloodless altar of the father
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
Apollo, he was admired by the inhabitants of the
island.</p>
<h3 id="c8">CHAP. VIII.</h3>
<p>At that time also, when he was journeying from
Sybaris to Crotona, he met near the shore with
some fishermen, who were then drawing their nets
heavily laden with fishes from the deep, and told
them he knew the exact number of the fish they
had caught. But the fishermen promising they
would perform whatever he should order them to
do, if the event corresponded with his prediction,
he ordered them, after they had accurately numbered
the fish, to return them alive to the sea: and
what is yet more wonderful, not one of the fish
died while he stood on the shore, though they had
been detained from the water a considerable time.
Having therefore paid the fishermen the price of
their fish, he departed for Crotona. But they every
where divulged the fact, and having learnt his name
from some children, they told it to all men. Hence
those that heard of this affair were desirous of seeing
the stranger, and what they desired was easily
obtained. But they were astonished on surveying
his countenance, and conjectured him to be such a
man as he was in reality. A few days also after
this, he entered the Gymnasium, and being surrounded
with a crowd of young men, he is said to
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
have delivered an oration to them, in which he incited
them to pay attention to their elders, evincing
that in the world, in life, in cities, and in nature,
that which has a precedency is more honorable
than that which is consequent in time. As for instance,
that the east is more honorable than the
west; the morning than the evening; the beginning
than the end; and generation than corruption.
In a similar manner he observed, that natives were
more honorable than strangers, and the leaders of
colonies than the builders of cities: and universally
Gods than d&aelig;mons; d&aelig;mons than demigods; and
heroes than men. Of these likewise he observed,
that the authors of generation are more honorable
than their progeny. He said these things, however,
for the sake of proving by induction, that
children should very much esteem their parents, to
whom he asserted they owed as many thanks as a
dead man would owe to him who should be able
to bring him back again into light. Afterwards,
he observed, that it was indeed just to love those
above all others, and never to give them pain, who
first benefited us, and in the greatest degree. But
parents alone benefit their children prior to their
birth, and are the causes to their offspring of all
their upright conduct; and that when children
show themselves to be in no respect inferior to
their parents in beneficence towards them, it is not
possible for them in this respect to err. For it is
reasonable to suppose, that the Gods will pardon
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
those who honor their parent in no less a degree
than the divinities themselves; since we learnt
from our parents to honor divinity. Hence Homer
also added the same appellation to the king of the
Gods; for he denominates him the father of Gods
and mortals. Many other mythologists also have
delivered to us, that the kings of the Gods have
been ambitious to vindicate to themselves that excessive
love which subsists through marriage, in
children towards their parents. And that on this
account, they have at the same time introduced the
hypothesis of father and mother among the Gods,<a class="fn" id="fr_12" href="#fn_12">[12]</a>
the former indeed generating Minerva, but the latter
Vulcan, who are of a nature contrary to each
other, in order that what is most remote may participate
of friendship.</p>
<p>All his auditors likewise having granted that the
judgment of the immortals is most valid, he said he
would demonstrate to the Crotonians, by the example
of Hercules the founder of the colony brought
to Crotona, that it is necessary to be voluntarily
obedient to the mandates of parents, as they knew
from tradition that the God himself had undertaken
such great labors in consequence of obeying
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
the commands of one older than himself, and being
victorious in what he had undertaken to accomplish,
had instituted in honor of his father the Olympic
games. He also showed them that they should
associate with each other in such a manner, as
never to be in a state of hostility to their friends,
but to become most rapidly friends to their enemies;
and that they should exhibit in modesty of
behaviour to their elders, the benevolent disposition
of children towards their parents; but in their philanthropy
to others, fraternal love and regard.</p>
<p>In the next place, he spoke concerning temperance,
and said, that the juvenile age should make
trial of its nature, this being the period in which
the desires are in the most florishing state.
Afterwards, he exhorted them to consider, that this
alone among the virtues was adapted to a boy and
a virgin, to a woman, and to the order of those of
a more advanced age; and that it was especially
accommodated to the younger part of the community.
He also added, that this virtue alone comprehended
the goods both of body and soul, as it
preserved the health and also the desire of the
most excellent studies. But this is evident from
the opposite. For when the Barbarians and Greeks
warred on each other about Troy, each of them fell
into the most dreadful calamities, through the incontinence
of one man, partly in the war itself, and
partly in returning to their native land. And divinity
ordained that the punishment of injustice alone
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
should endure for a thousand and ten years, predicting
by an oracle the capture of Troy, and
ordering that virgins should be annually sent by
the Locrians into the temple of Trojan Minerva.
Pythagoras also exhorted young men to the cultivation
of learning, calling on them to observe how
absurd it would be that they should judge the
reasoning power to be the most laudable of all
things, and should consult about other things
through this, and yet bestow no time nor labour in
the exercise of it; though the attention which is
paid to the body, resembles depraved friends, and
rapidly fails; but erudition, like worthy and good
men, endures till death, and for some persons procures
immortal renown after death. These and
other observations of the like kind, were made by
Pythagoras, partly from history, and partly from
[philosophic] dogmas, in which he showed that
erudition is a natural excellence of disposition common
to those in each genus, who rank in the first
class of human nature. For the discoveries of
these, become erudition to others. But this is naturally
so worthy of pursuit, that with respect to
other laudable objects of attainment, it is not possible
to partake of some of them through another
person, such as strength, beauty, health, and fortitude;
and others are no longer possessed by him
who imparts them to another, such as wealth, dominion,
and many other things which we shall omit
to mention. It is possible, however, for erudition
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
to be received by another, without in the least diminishing
that which the giver possesses. In a
similar manner also, some goods cannot be possessed
by men; but we are capable of being instructed,
according to our own proper and deliberate
choice. And in the next place, he who
being thus instructed, engages in the administration
of the affairs of his country, does not do this from
impudence, but from erudition. For by education
nearly men differ from wild beasts, the Greeks
from the Barbarians, those that are free from slaves,
and philosophers from the vulgar. And in short,
those that have erudition possess such a transcendency
with respect to those that have not, that
seven men have been found from one city, and in
one Olympiad, that were swifter than others in the
course; and in the whole of the habitable part of
the globe, those that excelled in wisdom were also
seven in number. But in the following times in
which Pythagoras lived, he alone surpassed all
others in philosophy. For he called himself by this
name [viz. a philosopher], instead of a wise man.</p>
<h3 id="c9">CHAP. IX.</h3>
<p>And this indeed is what he said to the young
men in the Gymnasium. But when they had told
their parents what they had heard, a thousand men
having called Pythagoras into the senate-house,
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
and praised him for what he had said to their sons,
desired him, if he had any thing advantageous to
say to the Crotonians, to unfold it to those who
were the leaders of the administration. He was
also the first that advised them to build a temple
to the Muses, in order that they might preserve
the existing concord. For he observed that all
these divinities were called by one common name,
[the Muses,] that they subsisted in conjunction
with each other, especially rejoiced in common
honors, and in short, that there was always one and
the same choir of the Muses. He likewise farther
observed, that they comprehended in themselves
symphony, harmony, rythm, and all things which
procure concord. They also evince that their
power does not alone extend to the most beautiful
theorems, but likewise to the symphony and harmony
of things. In the next place, he said it was
necessary they should apprehend that they received
their country from the multitude of the citizens, as
a common deposit. Hence, it was requisite they
should so govern it, that they might faithfully
transmit it to their posterity, as an hereditary possession.
And that this would firmly be effected,
if they were equal in all things to the citizens, and
surpassed them in nothing else than justice. For
men knowing that every place requires justice, have
asserted in fables that Themis has the same order
with Jupiter, that Dice, i.&nbsp;e. justice, is seated by
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
Pluto, and that Law is established in cities; in
order that he who does not act justly in things
which his rank in society requires him to perform,
may at the same time appear to be unjust towards
the whole world. He added, it was proper that
the senators should not make use of any of the
Gods for the purpose of an oath, but that their
language should be such as to render them worthy
of belief even without oaths. And likewise, that
they should so manage their own domestic affairs,
as to make the government of them the object of
their deliberate choice. That they should also be
genuinely disposed towards their own offspring, as
being the only animals that have a sensation of this
conception. And that they should so associate
with a wife the companion of life, as to be mindful
that other compacts are engraved in tables and
pillars, but those with wives are inserted in children.
That they should likewise endeavour to be beloved
by their offspring, not through nature, of which
they were not the causes, but through deliberate
choice: for this is voluntary beneficence.</p>
<p>He further observed, that they should be careful
not to have connexion with any but their wives, in
order that the wives may not bastardize the race
through the neglect and vicious conduct of the
husbands. That they should also consider, that
they received their wives from the Vestal hearth
with libations, and brought them home as if they
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
were suppliants, in the presence of the Gods themselves.
And that by orderly conduct and temperance,
they should become examples both to
their own families, and to the city in which they
live. That besides this, they should take care to
prevent every one from acting viciously, lest
offenders not fearing the punishment of the laws,
should be concealed; and reverencing beautiful
and worthy manners, they should be impelled to
justice. He also exhorted them to expel sluggishness
from all their actions; for he said that opportunity
was the only good in every action. But he
defined the divulsion of parents and children from
each other, to be the greatest of injuries. And
said, that he ought to be considered as the most
excellent man, who is able to foresee what will be
advantageous to himself; but that he ranks as the
next in excellence, who understands what is useful
from things which happen to others. But that he
is the worst of men who waits for the perception of
what is best, till he is himself afflicted. He likewise
said, that those who wish to be honored, will
not err if they imitate those that are crowned in
the course: for these do not injure their antagonists,
but are alone desirous that they themselves may
obtain the victory. Thus also it is fit that those
who engage in the administration of public affairs,
should not be offended with those that contradict
them, but should benefit such as are obedient to
them. He likewise exhorted every one who aspired
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
after true glory, to be such in reality as he wished
to appear to be to others: for counsel is not so
sacred a thing as praise; since the former is only
useful among men, but the latter is for the most
part referred to the Gods. And after all this he
added, that their city happened to be founded by
Hercules, at that time when he drove the oxen
through Italy, having been injured by Lacinius;
and when giving assistance by night to Croton, he
slew him through ignorance, conceiving him to be
an enemy. After which, Hercules promised that
a city should be built about the sepulchre of Croton,
and should be called from him Crotona, when
he himself became a partaker of immortality.
Hence Pythagoras said, it was fit that they should
justly return thanks for the benefit they had received.
But the Crotonians, on hearing this, built
a temple to the Muses, and dismissed the harlots
which they were accustomed to have. They also
requested Pythagoras to discourse to the boys in
the temple of Pythian Apollo, and to the women
in the temple of Juno.</p>
<h3 id="c10">CHAP. X.</h3>
<p>Pythagoras, therefore, complying with their
wish, is said to have given the boys the following
advice: That they should neither revile any one,
nor take vengeance on those that reviled. He
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
likewise exhorted them to pay diligent attention to
learning, which derives its appellation from their
age. He added, that it was easy for a modest
youth to preserve probity through the whole of life;
but that it was difficult for one to accomplish this,
who was not naturally well disposed at that age;
or rather it is impossible that he who begins his
course from a bad impulse, should run well to the
end. Besides this, he observed that boys were
most dear to divinity, and hence in times of great
drought, they were sent by cities to implore rain
from the Gods, in consequence of the persuasion that
divinity is especially attentive to children; though
such as are permitted to be continually conversant
with sacred ceremonies, scarcely obtain purification
in perfection. From this cause also, the most philanthropic
of the Gods, Apollo and Love, are
universally represented in pictures as having the
age of boys. It is likewise acknowledged, that
some of the games in which the conquerors are
crowned, were instituted on account of boys; the
Pythian, indeed, in consequence of the serpent
Python being slain by a boy; but the Nemean
and Isthmian, on account of the death of Archemorus
and Melicerta. Besides what has been said
likewise, while the city of Crotona was building,
Apollo promised to the founder, that he would
give him a progeny, if he brought a colony into
Italy; from which inferring that Apollo providentially
attended to the propagation of them, and that
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
all the Gods paid attention to every age, they
ought to render themselves worthy of their friendship.
He added, that they should exercise themselves
in hearing, in order that they may be able to
speak. And farther still, that as soon as they have
entered into the path in which they intend to proceed
to old age, they should follow the steps of
those that preceded them, and never contradict
those that are older than themselves. For thus
hereafter, they will justly think it right that neither
should they be injured by their juniors. On account
of these exhortations, it must be confessed
that he deserved not to be called by his own name,
but that all men should denominate him divine.</p>
<h3 id="c11">CHAP. XI.</h3>
<p>But to the women he is said to have discoursed
concerning sacrifices as follows: In the first place
indeed, as they would wish that another person
who intended to pray for them, should be worthy
and good, because the Gods attend to such as
these; thus also it is requisite that they should in
the highest degree esteem equity and modesty, in
order that the Gods may be readily disposed to
hear their prayers. In the next place, they should
offer to the Gods such things as they have produced
with their own hands, and should bring them
to the altars without the assistance of servants,
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">35</span>
such as cakes, honey-combs, and frankincense.
But that they should not worship divinity with
blood and dead bodies, nor offer many things at
one time, as if they never meant to sacrifice again.
With respect also to their association with men,
he exhorted them to consider that their parents
granted to the female nature, that they should love
their husbands in a greater degree than those who
were the sources of their existence. That in consequence
of this, they would do well either not to
oppose their husbands, or to think that they have
then vanquished, when they submit to them. Farther
still, in the same assembly also, Pythagoras is
said to have made that celebrated observation, that
it is holy for a woman, after having been connected
with her husband, to perform sacred rites on the
same day; but that this is never holy, after she has
been connected with any other man. He also exhorted
the women to use words of good omen
through the whole of life, and to endeavor that
others may predict good things of them. He likewise
admonished them not to destroy popular renown,
nor to blame the writers of fables, who surveying
the justice of women, from their accommodating
others with garments and ornaments, without
a witness, when it is necessary for some other
person to use them, and that neither litigation nor
contradiction are produced from this confidence,&mdash;have
feigned, that three women used but one eye
in common, on account of the facility of their communion
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
with each other. He farther observed,
that he who is called the wisest of all others, and
who gave arrangement to the human voice, and in
short, was the inventor of names, whether he was a
God or a d&aelig;mon, or a certain divine man,<a class="fn" id="fr_13" href="#fn_13">[13]</a> perceiving
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>
that the genus of women is most adapted
to piety, gave to each of their ages the appellation
of some God. Hence he called an unmarried
woman <i>Core</i>, i.&nbsp;e. Proserpine; but a bride, <i>Nympha</i>;
the woman who has brought forth children,
<i>Mater</i>; and a grandmother, according to the
Doric dialect, <i>Maia</i>. In conformity to which
also, the oracles in Dodona and at Delphi, are unfolded
in to light through a woman. But through
this praise pertaining to piety, Pythagoras is said
to have produced so great a change in female
attire, that the women no longer dared to clothe
themselves with costly garments, but consecrated
many myriads of their vestments in the temple of
Juno. The effect also of this discourse is said to
have been such, that about the region of the Crotonians
the fidelity of the husband to the wife was
universally celebrated; [imitating in this respect]
Ulysses, who would not receive immortality from
Calypso, on condition that he should abandon
Penelope. Pythagoras therefore also observed,
that it remained for the women to exhibit their
probity to their husbands, in order that they might
be equally celebrated with Ulysses. In short, it is
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
recorded that through the above-mentioned discourses,
Pythagoras obtained no moderate honor
and esteem, both in the city of the Crotonians and
throughout Italy.</p>
<h3 id="c12">CHAP. XII.</h3>
<p>It is also said, that Pythagoras was the first
who called himself a philosopher; this not being a
new name, but previously instructing us in a useful
manner in a thing appropriate to the name.
For he said that the entrance of men into the present
life, resembled the progression of a crowd to
some public spectacle. For there men of every
description assemble with different views; one
hastening to sell his wares for the sake of money
and gain; but another that he may acquire renown
by exhibiting the strength of his body; and there
is also a third class of men, and those the most
liberal, who assemble for the sake of surveying the
places, the beautiful works of art, the specimens of
valor, and the literary productions which are
usually exhibited on such occasions. Thus also in
the present life, men of all-various pursuits are
collected together in one and the same place. For
some are influenced by the desire of riches and
luxury; others by the love of power and dominion;
and others are possessed with an insane ambition
for glory. But the most pure and unadulterated
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">39</span>
character, is that of the man who gives
himself to the contemplation of the most beautiful
things, and whom it is proper to call a philosopher.<a class="fn" id="fr_14" href="#fn_14">[14]</a>
He adds, that the survey of all heaven, and of the
stars that revolve in it, is indeed beautiful, when
the order of them is considered. For they derive
this beauty and order by the participation of the
first and the intelligible essence. But that first
essence is the nature of number and reasons [i.&nbsp;e.
productive principles,] which pervades through all
things, and according to which all these [celestial
bodies] are elegantly arranged, and fitly adorned.
And wisdom indeed, truly so called, is a certain
science which is conversant with the first beautiful
objects,<a class="fn" id="fr_15" href="#fn_15">[15]</a> and these divine, undecaying, and possessing
an invariable sameness of subsistence; by the
participation of which other things also may be
called beautiful. But philosophy is the appetition
of a thing of this kind. The attention therefore to
erudition is likewise beautiful, which Pythagoras
extended, in order to effect the correction of mankind.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<h3 id="c13">CHAP. XIII.</h3>
<p>Moreover, if we may believe in so many ancient
and credible historians as have written concerning
him, the words of Pythagoras contained something
of a recalling and admonitory nature, which extended
as far as to irrational animals; by which it
may be inferred that learning predominates in those
endued with intellect, since it tames even wild
beasts, and those which are considered to be deprived
of reason. For it is said that Pythagoras
detained the Daunian bear which had most severely
injured the inhabitants, and that having gently
stroked it with his hand for a long time, fed it with
maze and acorns, and compelled it by an oath no
longer to touch any living thing, he dismissed it.
But the bear immediately after hid herself in the
mountains and woods, and was never seen from that
time to attack any irrational animal. Perceiving
likewise an ox at Tarentum feeding in a pasture,
and eating among other things green beans, he advised
the herdsman to tell the ox to abstain from
the beans. The herdsman, however, laughed at
him, and said that he did not understand the language
of oxen, but if Pythagoras did, it was in vain
to advise him to speak to the ox, but fit that he
himself should advise the animal to abstain from
such food. Pythagoras therefore, approaching to
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">41</span>
the ear of the ox, and whispering in it for a long
time, not only caused him then to refrain from
beans, but it is said that he never after tasted them.
This ox also lived for a long time at Tarentum
near the temple of Juno, where it remained when it
was old, and was called the sacred ox of Pythagoras.
It was also fed by those that came to it with
human food. When likewise he happened to be
conversing with his familiars about birds, symbols,
and prodigies, and was observing that all these are
the messengers of the Gods, sent by them to those
men who are truly dear to the Gods, he is said to
have brought down an eagle that was flying over
Olympia, and after gently stroking, to have dismissed
it. Through these things, therefore, and
other things similar to these, he demonstrated that
he possessed the same dominion as Orpheus, over
savage animals, and that he allured and detained
them by the power of voice proceeding from the
mouth.</p>
<h3 id="c14">CHAP. XIV.</h3>
<p>With him likewise the best principle originated
of a guardian attention to the concerns of men, and
which ought to be pre-assumed by those who intend
to learn the truth about other things. For he reminded
many of his familiars, by most clear and
evident indications, of the former life which their
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
soul lived, before it was bound to this body, and
demonstrated by indubitable arguments, that he
had been Euphorbus the son of Panthus, who conquered
Patroclus. And he especially praised the
following funeral Homeric verses pertaining to himself,
sung them most elegantly to the lyre, and frequently
repeated them.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;The shining circlets of his golden hair,</p>
<p class="t0">Which ev&rsquo;n the Graces might be proud to wear,</p>
<p class="t0">Instarr&rsquo;d with gems and gold, bestrow the shore</p>
<p class="t0">With dust dishonor&rsquo;d, and deform&rsquo;d with gore.</p>
<p class="t0">As the young olive in some sylvan scene,</p>
<p class="t0">Crown&rsquo;d by fresh fountains with eternal green,</p>
<p class="t0">Lifts the gay head, in snowy flowrets fair,</p>
<p class="t0">And plays and dances to the gentle air;</p>
<p class="t0">When lo! a whirlwind from high heav&rsquo;n invades</p>
<p class="t0">The tender plant, and withers all its shades;</p>
<p class="t0">It lies uprooted from its genial bed,</p>
<p class="t0">A lovely ruin now defac&rsquo;d and dead.</p>
<p class="t0">Thus young, thus beautiful, Euphorbus lay,</p>
<p class="t0">While the fierce Spartan tore his arms away.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_16" href="#fn_16">[16]</a></p>
</div>
<p>But what is related about the shield of this Phrygian
Euphorbus, being dedicated among other Trojan
spoils to Argive Juno, we shall omit, as being of a
very popular nature. That, however, which he
wished to indicate through all these particulars is
this, that he knew the former lives which he had
lived, and that from hence he commenced his providential
attention to others, reminding them of
their former life.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<h3 id="c15">CHAP. XV.</h3>
<p>Conceiving, however, that the first attention
which should be paid to men, is that which takes
place through the senses; as when some one perceives
beautiful figures and forms, or hears beautiful
rythms and melodies, he established that to be
the first erudition which subsists through music,
and also through certain melodies and rythms, from
which the remedies of human manners and passions
are obtained, together with those harmonies of
the powers of the soul which it possessed from the
first. He likewise devised medicines calculated to
repress and expel the diseases both of bodies and
souls. And by Jupiter that which deserves to be
mentioned above all these particulars is this, that
he arranged and adapted for his disciples what are
called apparatus and contrectations, divinely contriving
mixtures of certain diatonic, chromatic, and
euharmonic melodies, through which he easily
transferred and circularly led the passions of the
soul into a contrary direction, when they had recently
and in an irrational and clandestine manner
been formed; such as sorrow, rage, and pity, absurd
emulation and fear, all-various desires, angers,
and appetites, pride, supineness, and vehemence.
For he corrected each of these by the rule of virtue,
attempering them through appropriate melodies, as
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">44</span>
through certain salutary medicines. In the evening,
likewise, when his disciples were retiring to sleep,
he liberated them by these means from diurnal perturbations
and tumults, and purified their intellective
power from the influxive and effluxive waves of
a corporeal nature; rendered their sleep quiet, and
their dreams pleasing and prophetic. But when
they again rose from their bed, he freed them from
nocturnal heaviness, relaxation and torpor, through
certain peculiar songs and modulations, produced
either by simply striking the lyre, or employing the
voice. Pythagoras, however, did not procure for
himself a thing of this kind through instruments or
the voice, but employing a certain ineffable divinity,
and which it is difficult to apprehend, he extended
his ears, and fixed his intellect in the sublime symphonies
of the world, he alone hearing and understanding,
as it appears, the universal harmony and
consonance of the spheres, and the stars that are
moved through them, and which produce a fuller
and more intense melody than any thing effected by
mortal sounds.<a class="fn" id="fr_17" href="#fn_17">[17]</a> This melody also was the result of
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">45</span>
dissimilar and variously differing sounds, celerities,
magnitudes, and intervals, arranged with reference
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">46</span>
to each other in a certain most musical ratio, and
thus producing a most gentle, and at the same
time variously beautiful motion and convolution.
Being therefore irrigated as it were with this melody,
having the reason of his intellect well arranged
through it, and as I may say, exercised, he determined
to exhibit certain images of these things to
his disciples as much as possible, especially producing
an imitation of them through instruments,
and through the mere voice alone. For he conceived
that by him alone, of all the inhabitants of
the earth, the mundane sounds were understood and
heard, and this from a natural fountain itself and
root. He therefore thought himself worthy to be
<span class="pb" id="Page_47">47</span>
taught, and to learn something about the celestial
orbs, and to be assimilated to them by desire and
imitation, as being the only one on the earth
adapted to this by the conformation of his body,
through the d&aelig;moniacal power that inspired him.
But he apprehended that other men ought to be satisfied
in looking to him, and the gifts he possessed,
and in being benefited and corrected through images
and examples, in consequence of their inability to
comprehend truly the first and genuine archetypes
of things. Just, indeed, as to those who are incapable
of looking intently at the sun, through the
transcendent splendor of his rays, we contrive to
exhibit the eclipses of that luminary, either in the
profundity of still water, or through melted pitch,
or through some darkly-splendid mirror; sparing
the imbecility of their eyes, and devising a method
of representing a certain repercussive light, though
less intense than its archetype, to those who are delighted
with a thing of this kind. Empedocles also
appears to have obscurely signified this about Pythagoras,
and the illustrious and divinely-gifted
conformation of his body above that of other men,
when he says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was a man among them [i.&nbsp;e. among the
Pythagoreans] who was transcendent in knowledge,
who possessed the most ample stores of intellectual
wealth, and who was in the most eminent degree
the adjutor of the works of the wise. For when he
extended all the powers of his intellect, he easily
<span class="pb" id="Page_48">48</span>
beheld every thing, as far as to ten or twenty ages
of the human race.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the words <i>transcendent</i>, and <i>he beheld every
thing</i>, and <i>the wealth of intellect</i>, and the like,
especially exhibit the illustrious nature of the conformation
of his mind and body, and its superior
accuracy in seeing, and hearing, and in intellectual
perception.</p>
<h3 id="c16">CHAP. XVI.</h3>
<p>This adaptation therefore of souls was procured
by him through music. But another purification
of the dianoetic part,<a class="fn" id="fr_18" href="#fn_18">[18]</a> and at the same time of the
whole soul, through all-various studies, was effected
by him as follows: He conceived generally that
labor should be employed about disciplines and
studies, and ordained like a legislator, trials of the
most various nature, punishments, and restraints by
fire and sword, for innate intemperance, and an inexhaustible
avidity of possessing; which he who is
depraved can neither suffer nor sustain. Besides
these things also, he ordered his familiars to abstain
from all animals, and farther still from certain foods,
which are hostile to the reasoning power, and impede
its genuine energies. He likewise enjoined
<span class="pb" id="Page_49">49</span>
them continence of speech, and perfect silence,
exercising them for many years in the subjugation
of the tongue, and in a strenuous and assiduous investigation
and resumption of the most difficult
theorems. Hence also, he ordered them to abstain
from wine, to be sparing in their food, to sleep
little, and to have an unstudied contempt of, and
hostility to glory, wealth, and the like: to have an
unfeigned reverence of those to whom reverence is
due, a genuine similitude and benevolence to those
of the same age with themselves, and an attention
and incitation towards their juniors, free from all
envy. With respect to the amity also which subsists
in all things towards all, whether it be that of
Gods towards men through piety and scientific
theory, or of dogmas towards each other, or universally
of the soul towards the body, and of the rational
towards the irrational part, through philosophy,
and the theory pertaining to it; or whether it
be that of men to each other, of citizens indeed
through sound legislation, but of strangers through
a correct physiology; or of the husband to the wife,
or of brothers and kindred, through unperverted
communion; or whether, in short, it be of all things
towards all, and still farther, of certain irrational animals
through justice, and a physical connexion and
association; or whether it be the pacification and
conciliation of the body which is of itself mortal,
and of its latent contrary powers, through health,
and a diet and temperance conformable to this, in
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">50</span>
imitation of the salubrious condition of the mundane
elements;&mdash;of the appellation of all these, which
are summarily comprehended in one and the same
name, that of friendship, Pythagoras is acknowledged
to have been the inventor and legislator.
And, in short, he was the cause to his disciples of
the most appropriate converse with the Gods, both
when they were awake and when asleep; a thing
which never takes place in a soul disturbed by anger,
or pain, or pleasure, or, by Jupiter, by any
other base desire, or defiled by ignorance, which is
more unholy and noxious than all these. By all
these inventions, therefore, he divinely healed and
purified the soul, resuscitated and saved its divine
part, and conducted to the intelligible its divine
eye, which, as Plato says, is <a id="er1" href="#en1">better worth saving than ten thousand corporeal eyes</a>; for by looking
through this alone, when it is strengthened and
clarified by appropriate aids, the truth pertaining to
all beings is perceived. Referring therefore to this,
Pythagoras purified the dianoetic power of the soul.
Such also was the form with him of erudition, and
these were the things to which he directed his
view.</p>
<h3 id="c17">CHAP. XVII.</h3>
<p>As he therefore thus prepared his disciples for
erudition, he did not immediately receive into the
number of his associates those who came to him
<span class="pb" id="Page_51">51</span>
for that purpose, till he had made trial of, and judiciously
examined them. Hence in the first place
he inquired after what manner they associated with
their parents, and the rest of their relatives. In
the next place he surveyed their unseasonable
laughter, their silence, and their speaking when it
was not proper; and farther still, what their desires
were, with whom they associated, how they
conversed with them, in what they especially employed
their leisure time in the day, and what were
the subjects of their joy and grief. He likewise
surveyed, their form, their mode of walking, and the
whole motion of their body. Physiognomically
also considering the natural indications of their
frame, he made them to be manifest signs of the
unapparent manners of the soul. When, therefore,
he had thus made trial of some one, he suffered him
to be neglected for three years, in the mean time
observing how he was disposed with respect to stability,
and a true love of learning, and if he was
sufficiently prepared with reference to glory, so as
to despise [popular] honor. After this, he ordered
those who came to him to observe a quinquennial
silence, in order that he might experimentally
know how they were affected as to continence
of speech, the subjugation of the tongue being the
most difficult of all victories; as those have unfolded
to us who instituted the mysteries. During
this [probationary] time, however, the property of
each was disposed of in common, and was committed
<span class="pb" id="Page_52">52</span>
to the care of those appointed for this purpose,
who were called politicians, economizers, and
legislators. And with respect to these probationers,
those who appeared to be worthy to participate of
his dogmas, from the judgment he had formed of
them from their life and the modesty of their behaviour,
after the quinquennial silence, then became
<i>Esoterics</i>, and both heard and saw Pythagoras himself
within the veil. For prior to this they participated
of his words through the hearing alone, beyond
the veil, without at all seeing him, giving for
a long time a specimen of their peculiar manners.
But if they were rejected they received the double
of the wealth which they brought, and a tomb
was raised to them as if they were dead by the <i>homaco&iuml;</i>;
for thus all the disciples of the man were
called. And if they happened to meet with them
afterwards, they behaved to them as if they were
other persons, but said that they were dead,
whom they had modelled by education, in the expectation
that they would become truly good men
by the disciplines they would learn. They also
were of opinion that those who were more slow in
the acquisition of knowledge, were badly organized,
and, as I may say, imperfect and barren. If, however,
after Pythagoras had physiognomically considered
their form, their mode of walking, and
every other motion, and the state of their body,
and he had conceived good hope respecting them;
after likewise the quinquennial silence, and the orgies
<span class="pb" id="Page_53">53</span>
and initiations from so many disciplines, together
with the ablutions of the soul, and so many and
such great purifications produced from such various
theorems, through which the sagacity and sanctity
of the soul is perfectly ingenerated; if, after all this,
some one was found to be still sluggish and of a
dull intellect, they raised to such a one in the
school a certain pillar and monument, (as they are
said to have done to Perialus the Thurian, and
Cylon the prince of the Sybarites, who were rejected
by them) expelled him from the <i>Homaco&iuml;on</i> or auditory,
loading him with a great quantity of silver
and gold. For these were deposited by them in
common, and were committed to the care of certain
persons adapted to this purpose, and who were
called Economics, from the office which they bore.
And if afterwards they happened to meet with such
a one, they conceived him to be any other person,
than him who according to them was dead. Hence
also Lysis, blaming a certain person named Hipparchus,
because he had communicated the doctrines
of the Pythagoreans to the profane, and to
those who acceded to them without disciplines and
theory, says as follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is reported that you philosophize to every
one you may happen to meet, and publicly, which
Pythagoras did not think fit to do. And these
things, indeed, O Hipparchus, you learnt with diligent
assiduity, but you have not preserved them;
having tasted, O excellent man, of Sicilian delicacies,
<span class="pb" id="Page_54">54</span>
which you ought not to have tasted a second
time. If, therefore, you abandon these, I shall rejoice;
but if not, you will be dead in my opinion.
For it will be pious to call to mind the divine and
human precepts of Pythagoras, and not to make
the goods of wisdom common to those, who have
not even in a dream their soul purified. For it is
not lawful to extend to every casual person, things
which were obtained with such great labors, and
such diligent assiduity, nor to divulge the mysteries
of the Eleusinian Goddesses to the profane. For
those who do either of these, are equally unjust and
impious. But it will be well to consider what a
great length of time we consumed in wiping away
the stains which had insinuated themselves into our
breasts, till, after the lapse of some years, we became
fit recipients of the doctrines of Pythagoras.
For as dyers previously purify garments, and then
fix in the colors with which they wish them to be
imbued, in order that the dye may not be washed
away, and may never become evanescent; after
the same manner also that divine man prepared the
souls of those that were lovers of philosophy, so that
they might not deceive him in any of those beautiful
and good qualities which he hoped they would
possess. For he did not impart spurious doctrines,
nor snares, in which most of the sophists, who are
at leisure for no good purpose, entangle young men;
but he possessed a scientific knowledge of things
human and divine. These men, however, making
<span class="pb" id="Page_55">55</span>
his doctrine a pretext, perform many dreadful
deeds, ensnaring youth not in a becoming nor yet
in a casual way. Hence they render their auditors
noxious and precipitate. For they infuse theorems
and divine doctrines into confused and turbid manners.
Just as if some one should pour pure and
clear water into a deep well full of mud; for he
would disturb the mud, and destroy the clear water.
The same thing likewise takes place between
those who teach and those who are taught after
this manner. For dense thickets and which are
full of briars surround the intellect and heart of
those who have not been purely initiated in disciplines,
obscure the mild, tranquil, and reasoning
power of the soul, and openly impede the intellective
part from becoming increased and elevated.
It is requisite likewise to call intemperance and
avarice the mothers of these thickets; both which
are naturally prolific. From intemperance, therefore,
unlawful marriages, [unjust] desires, corruptions,
intoxication, preternatural pleasures, and
certain vehement appetites blossom forth, and
which impel their possessors into profundities and
precipices. For now desires have compelled some
not to abstain either from their mothers or their
daughters, and violating law, their country, city,
and king, with their hands as it were bound behind
them, they are violently dragged along like
slaves to extreme destruction. But from avarice
germinate rapine, robbery, parricide, sacrilege, sorcery,
<span class="pb" id="Page_56">56</span>
and such other evils at are the sisters of these.
In the first place, therefore, it is necessary to purify
the woods in which these passions have fixed their
abode, with fire and sword, and all the machines
of disciplines; and having liberated the reasoning
power from such mighty evils, we may then implant
in and deliver to it something useful and
good.&rdquo; So great and so necessary was the attention
which, according to Pythagoras, ought to be
paid to disciplines prior to philosophy. He likewise
ordained that a singular honor, and the most
accurate investigation, should be given to the
teaching and participation of his dogmas, as he
judiciously examined the conceptions of those that
came to him, by various documents, and ten thousand
forms of scientific theory.</p>
<h3 id="c18">CHAP. XVIII.</h3>
<p>After this we must narrate how, when he had
admitted certain persons to be his disciples, he
distributed them into different classes according to
their respective merits. For it was not fit that all
of them should equally participate of the same
things, as they were naturally dissimilar; nor was
it indeed right that some should participate of all
the most honorable auditions, but others of none,
or should not at all partake of them. For this
would be uncommunicative and unjust. While
<span class="pb" id="Page_57">57</span>
therefore he imparted a convenient portion of his
discourses to each, he benefited as much as possible
all of them, and preserved the proportion of
justice, by making each a partaker of the auditions
according to his desert. Hence, in conformity to
this method, he called some of them Pythagoreans,
but others Pythagorists; just as we denominate
some men Attics, but others Atticists. Having
therefore thus aptly divided their names, some of
them he considered to be genuine, but he ordained
that others should show themselves to be the emulators
of these. He ordered therefore that with
the Pythagoreans possessions should be shared in
common, and that they should always live together;
but that each of the others should possess his own
property apart from the rest, and that assembling
together in the same place, they should mutually
be at leisure for the same pursuits. And thus
each of these modes was derived from Pythagoras,
and transmitted to his successors. Again, there
were also with the Pythagoreans two forms of philosophy;
for there were likewise two genera of
those that pursued it, the Acusmatici, and the Mathematici.
Of these however the Mathematici are
acknowledged to be Pythagoreans by the rest; but
the Mathematici do not admit that the Acusmatici
are so, or that they derived their instruction from
Pythagoras, but from Hippasus. And with respect
to Hippasus, some say that he was a Crotonian,
but others a Metapontine. But the philosophy
<span class="pb" id="Page_58">58</span>
of the Acusmatici consists in auditions unaccompanied
with demonstrations and a reasoning
process; because it merely orders a thing to be
done in a certain way, and that they should endeavour
to preserve such other things as were said
by him, as so many divine dogmas. They however
profess that they will not speak of them, and
that they are not to be spoken of; but they conceive
those of their sect to be the best furnished
with wisdom, who retained what they had heard
more than others. But all these auditions are
divided into three species. For some of them indeed
signify what a thing is; others what it <i>especially</i>
is; but others, what ought, or what ought
not, to be done. The auditions therefore which
signify what a thing is, are such as, What are the
islands of the blessed? The sun and moon. What
is the oracle at Delphi? The tetractys. What is
harmony? <a id="er2" href="#en2">That in which the Syrens subsist</a>.<a class="fn" id="fr_19" href="#fn_19">[19]</a> But
the auditions which signify what a thing <i>especially</i>
is, are such as, What is the most just thing? To
<span class="pb" id="Page_59">59</span>
sacrifice. What is the wisest thing? Number.<a class="fn" id="fr_20" href="#fn_20">[20]</a>
But the next to this in wisdom, is that which gives
names to things. What is the wisest of the things
that are with us, [i.&nbsp;e. which pertain to human concerns]?
Medicine. What is the most beautiful?
Harmony. What is the most powerful? Mental
<span class="pb" id="Page_60">60</span>
decision. What is the most excellent? Felicity.
What is that which is most truly asserted? That
men are depraved. Hence they say that Pythagoras
praised the Salaminian poet Hippodomas,
because he sings:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Tell, O ye Gods! the source from whence you came,</p>
<p class="t0">Say whence, O men! thus evil you became?</p>
</div>
<p>These therefore, and such as these, are the auditions
of this kind. For each of these shows what a
thing <i>especially</i> is. This however is the same with
what is called the wisdom of the seven wise men.
For they investigated, not what is <i>simply</i> good, but
what is <i>especially</i> so; nor what is difficult, but
what is <i>most</i> difficult; viz. for a man to know himself.
Nor did they investigate what is easy, but
what is <i>most</i> easy; viz. to do what you are accustomed
to do. For it seems that such auditions as
the above, are conformable but posterior in time to
such wisdom as that of the seven wise men; since
they were prior to Pythagoras. The auditions
likewise, respecting what should or should not be
done, were such as, That it is necessary to beget
children. For it is necessary to leave those that
may worship the Gods after us.
<a id="er3" href="#en3">That it is requisite to put the shoe on the right foot first</a>.
<a id="er4" href="#en4">That it is not proper to walk in the public ways</a>, nor to dip
in a sprinkling vessel, nor to be washed in a bath.
For in all these it is immanifest, whether those
who use them are pure. Others also of this kind
<span class="pb" id="Page_61">61</span>
are the following:
<a id="er5" href="#en5">Do not assist a man in laying a burden down</a>; for it is not proper to be the
cause of not laboring; but assist him in taking it up.
<a id="er6" href="#en6">Do not draw near to a woman for the sake of begetting children, if she has gold.</a>
<a id="er7" href="#en7">Speak not about Pythagoric</a><a class="fn" id="fr_21" href="#fn_21">[21]</a> concerns without light. Perform
libations to the Gods, from the handle of the cup,
for the sake of an auspicious omen, and in order
that you may not drink from the same part [from
which you poured out the liquor.]
<a id="er8" href="#en8">Wear not the image of God in a ring</a>, in order that it may not be
defiled. For it is a resemblance which ought to
be placed in the house. It is not right to use a
woman ill; for she is a suppliant. On this account
also we bring her from the Vestal hearth,
and take her by the right hand.
<a id="er9" href="#en9">Nor is it proper to sacrifice a white cock; for this also is a suppliant, and is sacred to the moon.</a>
Hence likewise
it announces the hours. To him who asks
for counsel, give no other advice than that which is
the best: for counsel is a sacred thing. Labors
are good; but pleasures are in every respect bad.
For as we came into the present life for the purpose
of punishment, it is necessary that we should
be punished.
<a id="er10" href="#en10">It is proper to sacrifice, and to enter temples unshod</a>.
In going to a temple, it is
not proper to turn out of the way; for divinity
<span class="pb" id="Page_62">62</span>
should not be worshipped in a careless manner.
It is good to sustain, and to have wounds in the
breast; but it is bad to have them behind. The
soul of man alone does not enter into those animals,
which it is lawful to kill. Hence it is proper
to eat those animals alone which it is fit to slay,
but no other animal whatever. And such were the
auditions of this kind.</p>
<p>The most extended however were those concerning
sacrifices, how they ought to be performed
at all other times, and likewise when migrating
from the present life; and concerning sepulture,
and in what manner it is proper to be buried. Of
some of these therefore the reason is to be assigned
why they are ordered; such for instance as, it is
necessary to beget children, for the sake of leaving
another that may worship the Gods instead of
yourself. But of others no reason is to be assigned.
And of some indeed, the reasons are assumed
proximately; but of others, remotely; such as,
that bread is not to be broken, because it contributes
to the judgment in Hades. The probable
reasons however, which are added about things of
this kind, are not Pythagoric, but were devised by
some who philosophized differently from the Pythagoreans,
and who endeavoured to adapt probability
to what was said. Thus for instance, with
respect to what has been just now mentioned, why
bread is not to be broken, some say that it is not
proper to dissolve that which congregates. For
<span class="pb" id="Page_63">63</span>
formerly all those that were friends, assembled in a
barbaric manner to one piece of bread. But
others say, that it is not proper, in the beginning of
an undertaking, to produce an omen of this kind
by breaking and diminishing. Moreover, all such
precepts as define what is to be done, or what is
not to be done, refer to divinity as their end; and
every life is co-arranged so as to <i>follow God</i>. This
also is the principle and the doctrine of philosophy.
For men act ridiculously in searching for good any
where else than from the Gods. And when they
do so, it is just as if some one, in a country governed
by a king, should reverence one of the citizens who
is a magistrate, and neglect him who is the ruler of
all of them. For the Pythagoreans thought that
such men as we have just mentioned, performed a
thing of this kind. For since God is, and is the
lord of all things, it is universally acknowledged
that good is to be requested of him. For all men
impart good to those whom they love, and to those
with whom they are delighted; but they give the
contrary to good to those to whom they are contrarily
disposed. And such indeed is the wisdom
of these precepts.</p>
<p>There was, however, a certain person named
Hippomedon, an &AElig;gean, a Pythagorean and one
of the Acusmatici, who asserted that Pythagoras
gave the reasons and demonstrations of all these
precepts, but that in consequence of their being
delivered to many, and these such as were of a
<span class="pb" id="Page_64">64</span>
more sluggish genius, the demonstrations were
taken away, but the problems themselves were left.
Those however of the Pythagoreans that are called
<i>Mathematici</i>, acknowledge that these reasons and
demonstrations were added by Pythagoras, and
they say still more than this, and contend that their
assertions are true, but affirm that the following
circumstance was the cause of the dissimilitude.
Pythagoras, say they, came from Ionia and Samos,
during the tyranny of Polycrates, Italy being then
in a florishing condition; and the first men in the
city became his associates. But, to the more elderly
of these, and who were not at leisure [for philosophy],
in consequence of being occupied by political
affairs, the discourse of Pythagoras was not
accompanied with a reasoning process, because it
would have been difficult for them to apprehend
his meaning through disciplines and demonstrations;
and he conceived they would nevertheless
be benefited by knowing what ought to be done,
though they were destitute of the knowledge of the
<i>why</i>: just as those who are under the care of physicians,
obtain their health, though they do not
hear the reason of every thing which is to be done
to them. But with the younger part of his associates,
and who were able both to act and learn,&mdash;with
these he conversed through demonstration
and disciplines. These therefore are the assertions
of the Mathematici, but the former, of the Acusmatici.
With respect to Hippasus however especially,
<span class="pb" id="Page_65">65</span>
they assert that he was one of the Pythagoreans,
but that in consequence of having divulged
and described the method of forming a sphere from
twelve pentagons,<a class="fn" id="fr_22" href="#fn_22">[22]</a> he perished in the sea, as an
impious person, but obtained the renown of having
made the discovery. In reality, however, this as
well as every thing else pertaining to geometry, was
the invention of <i>that man</i>; for thus without mentioning
his name, they denominate Pythagoras.
But the Pythagoreans say, that geometry was divulged
from the following circumstance: A certain
Pythagorean happened to lose the wealth which he
possessed; and in consequence of this misfortune,
he was permitted to enrich himself from geometry.
But geometry was called by Pythagoras <i>Historia</i>.
And thus much concerning the difference of each
mode of philosophising, and the classes of the auditors
of Pythagoras. For those who heard him
either within or without the veil, and those who
heard him accompanied with seeing, or without
seeing him, and who are divided into interior and
exterior auditors, were no other than these. And
it is requisite to arrange under these, the political,
economic and legislative Pythagoreans.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<h3 id="c19">CHAP. XIX.</h3>
<p>Universally, however, it deserves to be known,
that Pythagoras discovered many paths of erudition,
and that he delivered an appropriate portion of
wisdom conformable to the proper nature and power
of each; of which the following is the greatest argument.
When Abaris, the Scythian, came from
the Hyperboreans, unskilled and uninitiated in the
Grecian learning, and was then of an advanced age,
Pythagoras did not introduce him to erudition
through various theorems, but instead of silence,
auscultation for so long a time, and other trials, he
immediately considered him adapted to be an auditor
of his dogmas, and instructed him in the shortest
way in his treatise On Nature, and in another treatise
On the Gods. For Abaris came from the Hyperboreans,
being a priest of the Apollo who is
there worshipped, an elderly man, and most wise in
sacred concerns; but at that time he was returning
from Greece to his own country, in order that he
might consecrate to the God in his temple among
the Hyperboreans, the gold which he had collected.
Passing therefore through Italy, and seeing Pythagoras,
he especially assimilated him to the God
of whom he was the priest. And believing that he
was no other than the God himself, and that no
man resembled him, but that he was truly Apollo,
<span class="pb" id="Page_67">67</span>
both from the venerable indications which he saw
about him, and from those which the priest had
known before, he gave Pythagoras a dart which he
took with him when he left the temple, as a thing
that would be useful to him in the difficulties that
would befal him in so long a journey. For he was
carried by it, in passing through inaccessible places,
such as rivers, lakes, marshes, mountains, and the
like, and performed through it, as it is said, lustrations,
and expelled pestilence and winds from the
cities that requested him to liberate them from
these evils. We are informed, therefore, that Laced&aelig;mon,
after having been purified by him, was no
longer infested with pestilence, though prior to this
it had frequently fallen into this evil, through the
baneful nature of the place in which it was built,
the mountains of Taygetus producing a suffocating
heat, by being situated above the city, in the same
manner as Cnossus in Crete. And many other similar
particulars are related of the power of Abaris.
Pythagoras, however, receiving the dart, and neither
being astonished at the novelty of the thing,
nor asking the reason why it was given to him, but
as if he was in reality a God himself, taking Abaris
aside, he showed him his golden thigh, as an indication
that he was not [wholly] deceived [in the
opinion he had formed of him;] and having enumerated
to him the several particulars that were
deposited in the temple, he gave him sufficient reason
to believe that he had not badly conjectured
<span class="pb" id="Page_68">68</span>
[in assimilating him to Apollo]. Pythagoras also
added, that he came [into the regions of mortality]
for the purpose of remedying and benefiting the
condition of mankind, and that on this account he
had assumed a human form, lest men being disturbed
by the novelty of his transcendency, should
avoid the discipline which he possessed. He likewise
exhorted Abaris to remain in that place, and
to unite with him in correcting [the lives and manners]
of those with whom they might meet; but to
share the gold which he had collected, in common
with his associates, who were led by reason to confirm
by their deeds the dogma, <i>that the possessions
of friends are common</i>. Thus, therefore, Pythagoras
unfolded to Abaris, who remained with him,
as we have just now said, physiology and theology
in a compendious way; and instead of divination
by the entrails of beasts, he delivered to him the
art of prognosticating through numbers, conceiving
that this was purer, more divine, and more adapted
to the celestial numbers of the Gods. He delivered
also to Abaris other studies which were
adapted to him. That we may return, however,
to that for the sake of which the present treatise
was written, Pythagoras endeavoured to correct
and amend different persons, according to the nature
and power of each. All such particulars
therefore as these, have neither been transmitted to
the knowledge of men, nor is it easy to narrate all
that has been transmitted to us concerning him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<h3 id="c20">CHAP. XX.</h3>
<p>We shall however exhibit a few specimens, and
those the most celebrated, of the Pythagoric discipline,
and also the monuments of the studies in which
those men engaged. In the first place, therefore,
Pythagoras in making trial [of the aptitude of those
that came to him] considered whether they could
<i>echemuthein</i>, i.&nbsp;e. whether they were able to refrain
from speaking (for this was the word which he
used), and surveyed whether they could conceal in
silence and preserve what they had learnt and
heard. In the next place, he observed whether
they were modest. For he was much more
anxious that they should be silent than that they
should speak. He likewise directed his attention
to every other particular; such, as whether they
were astonished by the energies of any immoderate
passion or desire. Nor did he in a superficial
manner consider how they were affected with respect
to anger or desire, or whether they were contentious
or ambitious, or how they were disposed
with reference to friendship or strife. And if on
his surveying all these particulars accurately, they
appeared to him to be endued with worthy manners,
then he directed his attention to their facility in
learning and their memory. And in the first place,
indeed he considered whether they were able to
<span class="pb" id="Page_70">70</span>
follow what was said, with rapidity and perspicuity;
but in the next place, whether a certain love and
temperance attended them towards the disciplines
which they were taught. For he surveyed how
they were naturally disposed with respect to gentleness.
But he called this <i>catartysis</i>, i.&nbsp;e. <i>elegance
of manners</i>. And he considered ferocity as hostile
to such a mode of education. For impudence,
shamelessness, intemperance, slothfulness, slowness
in learning, unrestrained licentiousness, disgrace,
and the like, are the attendants on savage manners;
but the contraries on gentleness and mildness.
He considered these things, therefore, in
making trial of those that came to him, and in these
he exercised the learners. And those that were
adapted to receive the goods of the wisdom he
possessed, he admitted to be his disciples, and thus
endeavoured to elevate them to scientific knowledge.
But if he perceived that any one of them
was unadapted, he expelled him as one of another
tribe, and a stranger.</p>
<p>In the next place, I shall speak of the studies
which he delivered through the whole of the day to
his associates. For those who committed themselves
to the guidance of his doctrine, acted in the following
manner: they performed their morning walks
alone, and in places in which there happened to be
an appropriate solitude and quiet, and where there
were temples and groves, and other things adapted
to give delight. For they thought it was not proper
<span class="pb" id="Page_71">71</span>
to converse with any one, till they had rendered
their own soul sedate, and had co-harmonised the
reasoning power. For they apprehended it to be
a thing of a turbulent nature to mingle in a crowd
as soon as they rose from bed. On this account
all the Pythagoreans always selected for themselves
the most sacred places. But after their morning
walk they associated with each other, and especially
in temples, or if this was not possible, in
places that resembled them. This time, likewise,
they employed in the discussion of doctrines and
disciplines, and in the correction of their manners.</p>
<h3 id="c21">CHAP. XXI.</h3>
<p>After an association of this kind, they turned
their attention to the health of the body. Most of
them, however, used unction and the course; but a
less number employed themselves in wrestling in
gardens and groves; others in leaping with leaden
weights in their hands, or in pantomime gesticulations,
with a view to the strength of this body, studiously
selecting for this purpose opposite exercises.
Their dinner consisted of bread and honey or the
honey-comb; but they did not drink wine during
the day. They also employed the time after dinner
in the political economy pertaining to strangers and
guests, conformably to the mandate of the laws.
For they wished to transact all business of this kind
<span class="pb" id="Page_72">72</span>
in the hours after dinner. But when it was evening
they again betook themselves to walking; yet
not singly as in the morning walk, but in parties
of two or three, calling to mind as they walked, the
disciplines they had learnt, and exercising themselves
in beautiful studies. After they had walked,
they made use of the bath; and having washed
themselves, they assembled in the place where they
eat together, and which contained no more than ten
who met for this purpose. These, however, being
collected together, libations and sacrifices were
performed with fumigations and frankincense.
After this they went to supper, which they finished
before the setting of the sun. But they made use
of wine and maze, and bread, and every kind of
food that is eaten with bread, and likewise raw and
boiled herbs. The flesh also of such animals was
placed before them as it was lawful to immolate;
but they rarely fed on fish: for this nutriment
was not, for certain causes, useful to them. In a
similar manner also they were of opinion, that the
animal which is not naturally noxious to the human
race, should neither be injured nor slain. But
after this supper libations were performed, and
these were succeeded by readings. It was the custom
however with them for the youngest to read,
and the eldest ordered what was to be read, and
after what manner. But when they were about to
depart, the cup-bearer poured out a libation for
them; and the libation being performed, the eldest
<span class="pb" id="Page_73">73</span>
announced to them the following precepts: That a
mild and fruitful plant should neither be injured
nor corrupted, nor in a similar manner, any animal
which is not noxious to the human race. And
farther still, that it is necessary to speak piously
and form proper conceptions of the divine, d&aelig;moniacal,
and heroic genera; and in a similar manner,
of parents and benefactors. That it is proper likewise
to give assistance to law, and to be hostile to
illegality. But these things being said, each departed
to his own place of abode. They also wore
a white and pure garment. And in a similar manner
they lay on pure and white beds, the coverlets
of which were made of thread; for they did not
use woollen coverlets. With respect to hunting
they did not approve of it, and therefore did not
employ themselves in an exercise of this kind.
Such therefore were the precepts which were daily
delivered to the disciples of Pythagoras, with respect
to nutriment and their mode of living.</p>
<h3 id="c22">CHAP. XXII.</h3>
<p>Another mode also of erudition is transmitted
to us, which was effected through Pythagoric precepts,
and sentences which extended to human life
and human opinions; a few of which out of many
I shall narrate. One of these therefore contains
an exhortation to remove contention and strife from
<span class="pb" id="Page_74">74</span>
true friendship, and especially from all friendship,
if possible. But if this is not possible, at least to
expel it from paternal friendship, and universally
from that which subsists with elders and benefactors.
For to contend pervicaciously with such as these,
anger or some other similar passion intervening, is
not to preserve, [but destroy] the existing friendship.
But they say it is necessary that the smallest
lacerations and ulcerations should take place in
friendships. And that this will be effected, if
both the friends know how to yield and subdue
their anger, and especially the younger of the two,
and who belongs to some one of the above-mentioned
orders. They likewise thought it necessary
that the corrections and admonitions which they
called <i>p&aelig;dartases</i>, and which the elder employed
towards the younger, should be made with much
suavity of manners and great caution; and also
that much solicitude and appropriation should be
exhibited in admonitions. For thus the admonition
will become decorous and beneficial. They
likewise say that faith should never be separated
from friendship, neither seriously nor in jest. For
it is no longer easy for the existing friendship to
remain in a sane condition, when falsehood once
insinuates itself into the manners of those who assert
themselves to be friends. And again they say,
that friendship is not to be rejected on account of
misfortune, or any other imbecility which happens
to human life; but that the only laudable rejection
<span class="pb" id="Page_75">75</span>
of a friend and of friendship, is that which takes
place through great and incurable vice. Such
therefore was the form of correction with the
Pythagoreans through sentences, and which extended
to all the virtues, and to the whole of life.</p>
<h3 id="c23">CHAP. XXIII.</h3>
<p>The mode however of teaching through symbols,
was considered by Pythagoras as most necessary.
For this form of erudition was cultivated by
nearly all the Greeks, as being most ancient. But
it was transcendently honored by the Egyptians,
and adopted by them in the most diversified manner.
Conformably to this, therefore, it will be
found, that great attention was paid to it by Pythagoras,
if any one clearly unfolds the significations
and arcane conceptions of the Pythagoric symbols,
and thus developes the great rectitude and truth
they contain, and liberates them from their enigmatic
form. For they are adapted according to a
simple and uniform doctrine, to the great geniuses
of these philosophers, and deify in a manner which
surpasses human conception. For those who came
from this school, and especially the most ancient
Pythagoreans, and also those young men who were
the disciples of Pythagoras when he was an old
man, viz. Philolaus<a class="fn" id="fr_23" href="#fn_23">[23]</a> and Eurytus, Charondas and
<span class="pb" id="Page_76">76</span>
Zaleucus, and Brysson, the elder Archytas also,
and Arist&aelig;us, Lysis and Empedocles, Zanolxis and
Epimenides, Milo and Leucippus, Alcm&aelig;on, Hippasus
and Thymaridas, and all of that age, consisting
of a multitude of learned men, and who were
above measure excellent,&mdash;all these adopted this
mode of teaching, in their discourses with each
other, and in their commentaries and annotations.
Their writings also, and all the books which they
published, <i>most of which have been preserved even
to our time</i>,<a class="fn" id="fr_24" href="#fn_24">[24]</a> were not composed by them in a popular
and vulgar diction, and in a manner usual with
all other writers, so as to be immediately understood,
but in such a way as not to be easily apprehended
by those that read them. For they adopted
that taciturnity which was instituted by Pythagoras
as a law, in concealing after an arcane mode,
divine mysteries from the uninitiated, and obscuring
their writings and conferences with each other.
Hence he who selecting these symbols does not unfold
their meaning by an apposite exposition, will
cause those who may happen to meet with them to
<span class="pb" id="Page_77">77</span>
consider them as ridiculous and inane, and as full
of nugacity and garrulity. When, however, they
are unfolded in a way conformable to these symbols,
and become obvious and clear even to the multitude,
instead of being obscure and dark, then they
will be found to be analogous to prophetic sayings,
and to the oracles of the Pythian Apollo. They
will then also exhibit an admirable meaning, and
will produce a divine afflatus in those who unite intellect
with erudition. Nor will it be improper to
mention a few of them, in order that this mode of
discipline may become more perspicuous:
<a id="er11" href="#en11">Enter not into a temple negligently, nor in short adore carelessly, not even though you should stand at the very doors themselves</a>.
Sacrifice and adore unshod.
Declining from the public ways, walk in unfrequented
paths. Speak not about Pythagoric concerns
without light. And such are the outlines of
the mode adopted by Pythagoras of teaching through
symbols.</p>
<h3 id="c24">CHAP. XXIV.</h3>
<p>Since, however, nutriment greatly contributes
to the best discipline, when it is properly used, and
in an orderly manner, let us consider what Pythagoras
also instituted as a law about this. Universally,
therefore, he rejected all such food as is flatulent,
and the cause of perturbation, but he approved
<span class="pb" id="Page_78">78</span>
of the nutriment contrary to this, and ordered it to
be used, viz. such food as composes and compresses
the habit of the body. Hence, likewise, he thought
that millet was a plant adapted to nutrition. But
he altogether rejected such food as is foreign to the
Gods; because it withdraws us from familiarity
with the Gods. Again, according to another mode
also, he ordered his disciples to abstain from such
food as is reckoned sacred, as being worthy of honor,
and not to be appropriated to common and
human utility. He likewise exhorted them to abstain
from such things as are an impediment to
prophesy, or to the purity and chastity of the soul,
or to the habit of temperance, or of virtue. And
lastly, he rejected all such things as are adverse to
sanctity, and which obscure and disturb the other
purities of the soul, and the phantasms which occur
in sleep. These things therefore he instituted as
laws in common about nutriment.</p>
<p>Separately, however, he forbade the most contemplative
of philosophers, and who have arrived
at the summit of philosophic attainments, the use of
superfluous and unjust food, and ordered them
never to eat any thing animated, nor in short, to
drink wine, nor to sacrifice animals to the Gods,
nor by any means to injure animals, but to preserve
most solicitously justice towards them. And he
himself lived after this manner, abstaining from
animal food, and adoring altars undefiled with
blood. He was likewise careful in preventing
<span class="pb" id="Page_79">79</span>
others from destroying animals that are of a kindred
nature with us, and rather corrected and instructed
savage animals through words and deeds, than injured
them through punishment. And farther
still, he also injoined those politicians that were
legislators to abstain from animals. For as they
wished to act in the highest degree justly, it is certainly
necessary that they should not injure any
kindred animal. Since, how could they persuade
others to act justly, if they themselves were detected
in indulging an insatiable avidity by partaking
of animals that are allied to us? For through the
communion of life and the same elements, and the
mixture subsisting from these, they are as it were
conjoined to us by a fraternal alliance. He permitted,
however, others whose life was not entirely
purified, sacred and philosophic, to eat of certain
animals; and for these he appointed a definite time
of abstinence.
<a id="er12" href="#en12">These therefore, he ordered not to eat the heart</a>,
<a id="er13" href="#en13">nor the brain</a>; and from the eating
of these he entirely prohibited all the Pythagoreans.
For these parts are of a ruling nature, and are as
it were certain ladders and seats of wisdom and
life. But other<a class="fn" id="fr_25" href="#fn_25">[25]</a> things were considered by him as
sacred on account of the nature of a divine reason.
Thus he exhorted his disciples <a id="er14" href="#en14">to abstain from mallows</a>, because this plant is the first messenger
<span class="pb" id="Page_80">80</span>
and signal of the sympathy of celestial with terrestrial
natures.
<a id="er15" href="#en15">Thus, too, he ordered them to abstain from the fish melanurus</a>;
for it is sacred to
the terrestrial Gods.
<a id="er16" href="#en16">And also not to receive the fish erythinus</a>,
through other such like causes.
<a id="er17" href="#en17">He likewise exhorted them to abstain from beans</a>, on
account of many sacred and physical causes, and
also such causes as pertain to the soul. And he
established as laws other precepts similar to these,
beginning through nutriment to lead men to virtue.</p>
<h3 id="c25">CHAP. XXV.</h3>
<p>Pythagoras was likewise of opinion that music
contributed greatly to health, if it was used in
an appropriate manner. For he was accustomed
to employ a purification of this kind, but not in a
careless way. And he called the medicine which
is obtained through music by the name of purification.
But he employed such a melody as this
about the vernal season. For he placed in the
middle a certain person who played on the lyre,
and seated in a circle round him those who were
able to sing. And thus, when the person in the
centre struck the lyre, those that surrounded him
sung certain p&aelig;ans, through which they were seen
to be delighted, and to become elegant and orderly
in their manners. But at another time they used
music in the place of medicine. And there are
<span class="pb" id="Page_81">81</span>
certain melodies devised as remedies against the
passions of the soul, and also against despondency
and lamentation,<a class="fn" id="fr_26" href="#fn_26">[26]</a> which Pythagoras invented as
things that afford the greatest assistance in these
maladies. And again, he employed other melodies
against rage and anger, and against every
aberration of the soul. There is also another kind
of modulation invented as a remedy against desires.
He likewise used dancing; but employed the lyre
as an instrument for this purpose. For he conceived
that the pipe was calculated to excite insolence,
was a theatrical instrument, and had by no
means a liberal sound.<a class="fn" id="fr_27" href="#fn_27">[27]</a> Select verses also of Homer
and Hesiod were used by him, for the purpose
of correcting the soul. Among the deeds of Pythagoras
likewise, it is said, that once through the
spondaic song of a piper, he extinguished the rage of
<span class="pb" id="Page_82">82</span>
a Tauromenian lad, who had been feasting by
night, and intended to burn the vestibule of his
mistress, in consequence of seeing her coming from
the house of his rival. For the lad was inflamed
and excited [to this rash attempt] by a Phrygian
song; which however Pythagoras most rapidly
suppressed. But Pythagoras, as he was astronomizing,
happened to meet with the Phrygian piper
at an unseasonable time of night, and persuaded
him to change his Phrygian for a spondaic song;
through which the fury of the lad being immediately
repressed, he returned home in an orderly
manner, though a little before this, he could not be
in the least restrained, nor would in short, bear any
admonition; and even stupidly insulted Pythagoras
when he met him. When a certain youth also
rushed with a drawn sword on Anchitus, the host
of Empedocles, because, being a judge, he had
publicly condemned his father to death, and would
have slain him as a homicide, Empedocles changed
the intention of the youth, by singing to his lyre
that verse of Homer,</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Nepenthe, without gall, o&rsquo;er every ill</p>
<p class="t0">Oblivion spreads;&mdash;&mdash;<a class="fn" id="fr_28" href="#fn_28">[28]</a></p>
</div>
<p>and thus snatched his host Anchitus from death,
and the youth from the crime of homicide. It is
also related that the youth from that time became
<span class="pb" id="Page_83">83</span>
the most celebrated of the disciples of Pythagoras.
Farther still, the whole Pythagoric school produced
by certain appropriate songs, what they called
<i>exartysis</i> or adaptation, <i>synarmoge</i> or elegance of
manners, and <i>epaphe</i> or contact, usefully conducting
the dispositions of the soul to passions contrary
to those which it before possessed. For when they
went to bed they purified the reasoning power from
the perturbations and noises to which it had been
exposed during the day, by certain odes and peculiar
songs, and by this means procured for themselves
tranquil sleep, and few and good dreams.
But when they rose from bed, they again liberated
themselves from the torpor and heaviness of sleep,
by songs of another kind. Sometimes, also, by
musical sounds alone, unaccompanied with words,
they healed the passions of the soul and certain
diseases, enchanting, as they say, in reality. And
it is probable that from hence this name <i>epode</i>, i.&nbsp;e.
enchantment, came to be generally used. After
this manner, therefore, Pythagoras through music
produced the most beneficial correction of human
manners and lives.</p>
<h3 id="c26">CHAP. XXVI.</h3>
<p>Since, however, we are narrating the wisdom
employed by Pythagoras in instructing his disciples,
it will not be unappropriate to relate that
<span class="pb" id="Page_84">84</span>
which is proximate in a following order to this, viz.
how he invented the harmonic science, and harmonic
ratios. But for this purpose we must begin
a little higher. Intently considering once, and
reasoning with himself, whether it would be possible
to devise a certain instrumental assistance to the
hearing, which should be firm and unerring, such as
the sight obtains through the compass and the rule,
or, by Jupiter, through a dioptric instrument; or
such as the touch obtains through the balance, or
the contrivance of measures;&mdash;thus considering, as
he was walking near a brazier&rsquo;s shop, he heard from
a certain divine casualty the hammers beating out
a piece of iron on an anvil, and producing sounds
that accorded with each other, one combination
only excepted. But he recognized in those sounds,
the diapason, the diapente, and the diatessaron,
harmony. He saw, however, that the sound which
was between the diatessaron and the diapente was
itself by itself dissonant, yet, nevertheless, gave
completion to that which was the greater sound
among them. Being delighted, therefore, to find
that the thing which he was anxious to discover had
succeeded to his wishes by divine assistance, he
went into the brazier&rsquo;s shop, and found by various
experiments, that the difference of sound arose
from the magnitude of the hammers, but not from
the force of the strokes, nor from the figure of the
hammers, nor from the transposition of the iron
which was beaten. When, therefore, he had accurately
<span class="pb" id="Page_85">85</span>
examined the weights and the equal counterpoise
of the hammers, he returned home, and
fixed one stake diagonally to the walls, lest if there
were many, a certain difference should arise from
this circumstance, or in short, lest the peculiar nature
of each of the stakes should cause a suspicion
of mutation. Afterwards, from this stake he suspended
four chords consisting of the same materials,
and of the same magnitude and thickness, and likewise
equally twisted. To the extremity of each
chord also he tied a weight. And when he had
so contrived, that the chords were perfectly equal
to each other in length, he afterwards alternately
struck two chords at once, and found the before-mentioned
symphonies, viz. a different symphony
in a different combination. For he discovered that
the chord which was stretched by the greatest
weight, produced, when compared with that which
was stretched by the smallest, the symphony diapason.
But the former of these weights was twelve
pounds, and the latter six. And, therefore, being
in a duple ratio, it exhibited the consonance diapason;
which the weights themselves rendered
apparent. But again, he found that the chord
from which the greatest weight was suspended
compared with that from which the weight next to
the smallest depended, and which weight was eight
pounds, produced the symphony diapente. Hence
he discovered that this symphony is in a sesquialter
ratio, in which ratio also the weights were to each
<span class="pb" id="Page_86">86</span>
other. And he found that the chord which was
stretched by the greatest weight, produced, when
compared with that which was next to it in weight,
and was nine pounds, the symphony diatessaron,
analogously to the weights. This ratio, therefore,
he discovered to be sesquitertian; but that of the
chord from which a weight of nine pounds was suspended,
to the chord which had the smallest weight
[or six pounds,] to be sesquialter. For 9 is to 6
in a sesquialter ratio. In like manner, the chord
next to that from which the smallest weight depended,
was to that which had the smallest weight,
in a sesquitertian ratio, [for it was the ratio of 8
to 6,] but to the chord which had the greatest
weight, in a sesquialter ratio [for such is the ratio
of 12 to 8.] Hence, that which is between the
diapente and the diatessaron, and by which the
diapente exceeds the diatessaron, is proved to be
in an epogdoan ratio, or that of 9 to 8. But
either way it may be proved that the diapason is a
system consisting of the diapente in conjunction
with the diatessaron, just as the duple ratio consists
of the sesquialter and sesquitertian, as for instance,
12, 8, and 6; or conversely, of the diatessaron
and the diapente, as in the duple ratio of the
sesquitertian and sesquialter ratios, as for instance
12, 9, and 6. After this manner, therefore, and
in this order, having conformed both his hand and
his hearing to the suspended weights, and having
established according to them the ratio of the habitudes,
<span class="pb" id="Page_87">87</span>
he transferred by an easy artifice the common
suspension of the chords from the diagonal
stake to the limen of the instrument, which he
called <i>chordotonon</i>. But he produced by the aid of
pegs a tension of the chords analogous to that
effected by the weights.</p>
<p>Employing this method, therefore, as a basis,
and as it were an infallible rule, he afterwards extended
the experiment to various instruments; viz.
to the pulsation of patell&aelig; or pans, to pipes and
reeds, to monochords, triangles, and the like. And
in all these he found an immutable concord with
the ratio of numbers. But he denominated the
sound which participates of the number 6 <i>hypate</i>:
that which participates of the number 8 and is sesquitertian,
<i>mese</i>; that which participates of the number
9, but is more acute by a tone than mese, he
called <i>paramese</i>, and <i>epogdous</i>; but that which
participates of the dodecad, <i>nete</i>. Having also
filled up the middle spaces with analogous sounds
according to the diatonic genus, he formed an
octochord from symphonious numbers, viz. from
the double, the sesquialter, the sesquitertian, and
from the difference of these, the epogdous. And
thus he discovered the [harmonic] progression,
which tends by a certain physical necessity from
the most grave [i.&nbsp;e. flat] to the most acute sound,
according to this diatonic genus. For from the
diatonic, he rendered the chromatic and enharmonic
<span class="pb" id="Page_88">88</span>
genus perspicuous, as we shall some time or
other show when we treat of music. This diatonic
genus, however, appears to have such physical
gradations and progressions as the following; viz.
a semitone, a tone, and then a tone; and this is the
diatessaron, being a system consisting of two tones,
and of what is called a semitone. Afterwards,
another tone being assumed, viz. the one which is
intermediate, the diapente is produced, which is a
system consisting of three tones and a semitone. In
the next place to this is the system of a semitone, a
tone, and a tone, forming another diatessaron, i.&nbsp;e.
another sesquitertian ratio. So that in the more
ancient heptachord indeed, all the sounds, from the
most grave, which are with respect to each other
fourths, produce every where with each other the
symphony diatessaron; the semitone receiving by
transition, the first, middle, and third place, according
to the tetrachord. In the Pythagoric
octachord, however, which by conjunction is a
system of the tetrachord and pentachord, but if
disjoined is a system of two tetrachords separated
from each other, the progression is from the most
grave sound. Hence all the sounds that are by
their distance from each other fifths, produce with
each other the symphony diapente; the semitone
successively proceeding into four places, viz. the
first, second, third, and fourth.
<a id="erx" href="#enx">After this manner, therefore, it is said that music was discovered by Pythagoras.</a>
<span class="pb" id="Page_89">89</span>
And having reduced it to a system,
he delivered it to his disciples as subservient to
every thing that is most beautiful.<a class="fn" id="fr_29" href="#fn_29">[29]</a></p>
<h3 id="c27">CHAP. XXVII.</h3>
<p>Many also of the political actions of his followers
are [deservedly] praised. For it is reported
that the Crotonians being once impelled to make
sumptuous funerals and interments, some one of
them said to the people, that he had heard Pythagoras
when he was discoursing about divine natures
observe, that the Olympian Gods attended
to the dispositions of those that sacrificed, and not
to the multitude of the sacrifices; but that, on the
contrary, the terrestrial Gods, as being allotted the
government of things less important, rejoiced in
banquets and lamentations, and farther still, in
continual libations, in delicacies, and in celebrating
funerals with great expense. Whence, on account
of his wish to receive, Pluto is called Hades. He
suffers, therefore, those that slenderly honor him to
remain for a longer time in the upper world; but
he always draws down some one of those who are
disposed to spend profusely in funeral solemnities,
in order that he may obtain the honors which take
<span class="pb" id="Page_90">90</span>
place in commemoration of the dead. In consequence
of this advice, the Crotonians that heard it
were of opinion, that if they conducted themselves
moderately in misfortunes, they would preserve
their own salvation; but that if they were immoderate
in their expenses, they would all of them die
prematurely. A certain person also having been
made an arbitrator in an affair in which there was
no witness, led each of the litigants to a certain
monument, and said to one of them, the man who
is buried in this monument was transcendently
equitable; in consequence of which the other litigant
prayed that the dead man might obtain much
good; but the former said that the defunct was not
at all better for the prayers of his opponent. Pythagoras,
therefore, condemned what the former
litigant said, but asserted that he who praised the
dead man for his worth, had done that which would
be of no small importance in his claim to belief.
At another time, in a cause of great moment, he
decided that one of the two who had agreed to
settle the affair by arbitration, should pay four talents,
but that the other should receive two.
Afterwards, he condemned the defendant to pay
three talents; and thus he appeared to have given
a talent to each of them. Two persons also had
fraudulently deposited a garment with a woman who
belonged to a court of justice, and told her she was
not to give it to either of them unless both were
present. Some time after, for the purpose of circumvention,
<span class="pb" id="Page_91">91</span>
one of them received the common deposit,
and said that it was with the consent of the
other. But the other, who had not been present
[when the garment was returned], acted the part of
a sycophant, and related the compact that was
made at the beginning, to the magistrates. A certain
Pythagorean, however, taking up the affair
said, that the woman had acted conformably to the
compact, as both parties had been present. Two
other persons also appeared to have a strong
friendship for each other, but had fallen into a
silent suspicion through a flatterer of one of them,
who told him that his wife had been corrupted by
the other. It so happened however, that a Pythagorean
came into a brazier&rsquo;s shop, where he who
conceived himself to be injured, was showing to the
artist a sword which he had given him to sharpen,
and was indignant with him because it was not sufficiently
sharp. The Pythagorean, therefore, suspecting
that the sword was intended to be used
against him who was accused of adultery, said, This
sword is sharper than all things except calumny.
This being said, caused the man to consider with
himself [what it was he intended to do], and not
rashly to sin against his friend who was within, and
who had been previously called [by him in order
that he might kill him]. A zone also that had
golden ornaments having fallen [at the feet] of a
certain stranger in the temple of Esculapius, and
the laws forbidding any one to take up that which
<span class="pb" id="Page_92">92</span>
had fallen on the ground, a Pythagorean advised
the stranger, who was indignant at this prohibition,
to take away the golden ornaments which had not
fallen to the ground, but to leave the zone, because
this was on the ground.<a class="fn" id="fr_30" href="#fn_30">[30]</a> That circumstance, likewise,
which by the ignorant is transferred to other places, is
said to have happened in Crotona, viz. that during a
public spectacle, some cranes flew over the theatre,
and one of those who had sailed into the port, said
to the person who sat near him, Do you see the
witnesses? which being heard by a certain Pythagorean,
he brought them into the court, consisting
of a thousand magistrates, where being examined, it
was found that they had thrown certain boys into
the sea, and that they called the cranes who flew
over the ship [at the time,] witnesses of the deed.
When likewise certain persons who had recently
become disciples of Pythagoras were at variance
with each other, he who was the junior of the two
came to the other and said to him, that there was
no occasion to refer the affair to a third person,
<span class="pb" id="Page_93">93</span>
but that it rested with them to commit their anger
to oblivion. He, therefore, to whom these words
were addressed, replied that he was very much
pleased in other respects with what had been said,
but that he was ashamed that, being the elder, he
had not first said the same thing to the other [who
was the junior]. We might here also narrate what
is said of Phinthias and Damon,<a class="fn" id="fr_31" href="#fn_31">[31]</a> of Plato and Archytas,
and likewise of Clinias and Prorus.<a class="fn" id="fr_32" href="#fn_32">[32]</a>
Omitting, however, these [for the present], we
shall mention what is related of Eubulus the Messenian,
who when he was sailing homeward, and
was taken captive by the Tyrrhenians, was recognized
by Nausitheus a Tyrrhenian and also a Pythagorean,
because he was one of the disciples of Pythagoras,
and was taken by him from the pirates,
and brought with great safety to Messena. When
the Carthaginians, also, were about to send more
than five thousand soldiers into a desert island,
Miltiades the Carthaginian, perceiving among them
the Argive Possiden (both of them being Pythagoreans),
went to him, and not manifesting what he
intended to do, advised him to return to his native
country, with all possible celerity, and having
placed him in a ship that was then sailing near the
shore, supplied him with what was necessary for
his voyage, and thus saved the man from the dangers
<span class="pb" id="Page_94">94</span>
[to which he was exposed]. In short, he who
should relate all that has taken place among the
Pythagoreans in their associations with each other,
would by the length of his narration exceed the
proper quantity and the occasion of his treatise.</p>
<p>I shall therefore rather pass on to show, that
some of the Pythagoreans were political characters,
and adapted to govern. For they were guardians
of the laws, and ruled over certain Italian cities,
unfolding to them, and counselling them to adopt
the most excellent measures, but abstaining from
public revenues. And though they were greatly
calumniated, yet at the same time the probity of
the Pythagoreans, and the wish of the cities themselves
prevailed, so that they were desired by them
to administer their political concerns. But at this
time the most beautiful of polities appear to have
existed in Italy and in Sicily. For Charondas the
Catanean, who appears to have been one of the
best legislators, was a Pythagorean; as were also
the Locrians Zaleucus and Timares, who were celebrated
for their legislation. Those also who
established the Rheginic polities, that polity which
is called Gymnasiarchic, and that which is denominated
from Theocles, are said to have been
Pythagoreans. Phytius likewise, Theocles, Elecaon,
and Aristocrates, excelled among the Pythagoreans
in their studies and manners, which also
the cities in those places adopted at those times.
In short, it is asserted that Pythagoras was the inventor
<span class="pb" id="Page_95">95</span>
of the whole of political erudition, when he
said that nothing is pure among things that have an
existence; but that earth participates of fire, fire of
air, air of water, and water of spirit. And in a
similar manner the beautiful participates of the deformed,
the just of the unjust, and other things
conformably to these. From this hypothesis, however,
the reasoning tends to either part. He also
said, that there are two motions of the body and
the soul; the one being irrational, but the other
the effect of deliberate choice. That three certain
lines also constitute polities, the extremes of which
mutually touch each other, and produce one right
angle; so that one of them has the nature of the
sesquitertian; another that of the diapente; and
the third is a medium between the other two.<a class="fn" id="fr_33" href="#fn_33">[33]</a>
But when we consider by a reasoning process the
coincidences of the lines with each other, and also
of the places under these, we shall find that they
represent the best image of a polity. Plato has
made the glory of this invention his own; for he
clearly says in his Republic, &ldquo;that the sesquitertian
progeny conjoined with the pentad produces
two harmonies.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_34" href="#fn_34">[34]</a> It is also said, that Pythagoras
cultivated the moderation of the passions, and mediocrity,
<span class="pb" id="Page_96">96</span>
and that by the conjunction of a certain
precedaneous good, he rendered the life of each of
his disciples happy. And in short, it is said that
he discovered the choice of our good, and of the
works adapted to our nature. It is likewise narrated
of him, that he withdrew the Crotonians from
harlots, and universally from an association with
women that were not affianced. For the wives of
the Crotonians came to Theano the wife of Brontinus,
one of the Pythagoreans, a woman of a wise
and excellent soul, (and who was the author of that
beautiful and admirable saying, &ldquo;that it is lawful for
a woman to sacrifice on the very day in which she
has risen from the embraces of her husband,&rdquo; which
some ascribe to Theano the wife of Pythagoras)
the Crotonian wives came therefore to her, and
entreated her to persuade Pythagoras to discourse
to them on the continence which was due from
them to their husbands. This she promised to do;
and Pythagoras having accordingly made an oration
to the Crotonians, which had the desired effect, the
incontinence which then prevailed was entirely destroyed.
It is further related likewise, that when
ambassadors came to the city of the Crotonians
from Sybaris, for the purpose of demanding the
exiles, Pythagoras beholding one of the ambassadors,
who with his own hand had slain one of his
friends, made him no answer. But when the man
interrogated him, and wished to converse with him,
Pythagoras said, that it was not lawful to discourse
<span class="pb" id="Page_97">97</span>
with homicides. Whence also by certain persons
he was thought to be Apollo. All these particulars,
therefore, and such as we have a little before mentioned
concerning the destruction of tyrants, and the
liberation of the cities of Italy and Sicily, and many
other circumstances, are indications of the benefits
conferred on mankind by Pythagoras in political
concerns.</p>
<h3 id="c28">CHAP. XXVIII.</h3>
<p>That which follows after this, we shall no
longer discuss generally, but direct our attention
particularly to the works resulting from the virtues
of Pythagoras. And we shall begin in the first
place from the Gods, as it is usual to do, and endeavour
to exhibit his piety, and the admirable
works which he performed. Let this, therefore, be
one specimen of his piety, which also we have before
mentioned, that he knew what his soul was,
and whence it came into the body, and also its
former lives, and that of these things he gave most
evident indications. After this also, let the following
be another specimen; that once passing over
the river Nessus with many of his associates, he
spoke to it, and the river in a distinct and clear
voice, in the hearing of all his followers, answered,
<i>Hail Pythagoras!</i> Farther still, nearly all historians
of his life confidently assert, that in one and
<span class="pb" id="Page_98">98</span>
the same day he was present at Metapontum in
Italy, and Tauromenium in Sicily, and discoursed
in common with his disciples in both places, though
these cities are separated from each other by many
stadia both by land and sea, and cannot be passed
through in a great number of days. The report,
also, is very much disseminated, that he showed
his golden thigh to the Hyperborean Abaris, who
said that he resembled the Apollo among the Hyperboreans,
and of whom Abaris was the priest;
and that he did this in order that Abaris might
apprehend this to be true, and that he was not deceived
in his opinion. Ten thousand other more
divine and more admirable particulars likewise are
uniformly and unanimously related of <i>the man</i>:
<a id="er18" href="#en18">such as infallible predictions of earthquakes</a>, rapid
expulsions of pestilence and violent winds, instantaneous
cessations of the effusion of hail, and a
tranquillization of the waves of rivers and seas, in
order that his disciples might easily pass over them.
Of which things also, Empedocles the Agrigentine,
Epimenides the Cretan, and Abaris the Hyperborean,
receiving the power of effecting, performed
certain miracles of this kind in many places. Their
deeds, however, are manifest. To which we may
add, that Empedocles was surnamed <i>an expeller of
winds</i>; Epimenides, <i>an expiator</i>; and Abaris, <i>a
walker on air</i>; because being carried on the dart
which was given to him by the Hyperborean
Apollo, he passed over rivers and seas and inaccessible
<span class="pb" id="Page_99">99</span>
places, like one walking on the air. Certain
persons likewise are of opinion, that Pythagoras
did the same thing, when in the same day he
discoursed with his disciples at Metapontum and
Tauromenium. It is also said, that he predicted
there would be an earthquake from the water of a
well which he had tasted; and that a ship which
was sailing with a prosperous wind, would be
merged in the sea. And let these, indeed, be the
indications of his piety.</p>
<p>Again, however, assuming a more elevated exordium,
I am desirous to exhibit the principles of
the worship of the Gods, which Pythagoras and his
followers established; viz. that all such particulars
as they define with respect to doing or not doing a
thing, have for the mark at which they aim, a consent
with divinity. This also is with them the principle,
[of piety] and their whole life is arranged with
a view <i>to follow God</i>. The language, too, of their
philosophy is this, that men act ridiculously in exploring
good from any other source than the Gods;
and that their conduct in this respect resembles
that of a man, who in a country governed by a
king should reverence one of the magistrates in the
city, and neglect him who is the ruler of all of them.
For they were of opinion that such was the conduct
of mankind. For since God is, and is the
Lord of all things, it is universally acknowledged
that good is to be requested of him. For all men
impart good to those whom they love, and to those
<span class="pb" id="Page_100">100</span>
with whom they are delighted; but they give the
contrary to good, to those to whom they are contrarily
disposed. It is evident, therefore, that those
things are to be done, in which God delights. It
is, however, not easy for a man to know what these
are, unless he obtains this knowledge from one who
has heard God, or has heard God himself, or procures
it through divine art. Hence also, the Pythagoreans
were studious of divination. For this
alone is an interpretation of the benevolence of the
Gods. And in short, he will conceive an employment
of this kind to be worthy of regard, who believes
that there are Gods; but he who thinks that
either of these is folly, will also be of opinion that
both are foolish. Many of the mandates, however,
of the Pythagoreans were introduced from the
mysteries; for they did not conceive them to be
the productions of arrogance, but to originate from
a certain divinity. And in a similar manner, all
the Pythagoreans believe such things as are mythologically
related of Aristeas the Proconesian, and
Abaris the Hyperborean, and other particulars of a
like nature. For they consider every thing of this
kind to be credible; and of many [such] things they
make trial themselves. They also frequently recollect
such-like particulars as appear to be fabulous,
as not disbelieving in any thing which may be
referred to divinity. A certain person therefore
relates, that Eurytus said, that a shepherd feeding
his sheep near the tomb of Philolaus, heard some
<span class="pb" id="Page_101">101</span>
one singing. But the person to whom this was
related, did not at all disbelieve the narration, but
asked what kind of harmony it was? Both of them,
however, were Pythagoreans, and Eurytus was the
disciple of Philolaus. It is likewise said, that a
certain person told Pythagoras, that he appeared to
himself once to converse with his father who was
dead, and that he asked Pythagoras what this indicated?
Pythagoras replied, that it indicated nothing;
but that he had in reality conversed with
his father. As therefore, said he, nothing is signified
by my now discoursing with you, so neither is
any thing signified by your conversing with your
father. Hence, in all particulars of this kind, they
did not think that they were stupid, but those that
disbelieved in them. For they did not conceive
that some things are possible to the Gods, but
others impossible, as those fancy who reason sophistically;
but they believed that all things are possible
to the Gods. And this very assertion is the beginning
of the verses, which they ascribe to Linus,
and which are as follow:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">All things may be the objects of our hope,</p>
<p class="t0">Since nothing hopeless any where is found:</p>
<p class="t0">All things with ease Divinity effects,</p>
<p class="t0">And nought can frustrate his almighty power.</p>
</div>
<p>But they thought that their opinions deserved to be
believed, because he who first promulgated them,
was not any casual person, but a God. For this
<span class="pb" id="Page_102">102</span>
was one of their questions; What was Pythagoras?
For they say that he was the Hyperborean Apollo;
of which this was an indication, that rising up in
the Olympic games, he showed his golden thigh;
and also that he received the Hyperborean Abaris
as his guest; and was presented by him with the
dart on which he rode through the air. But it is
said that Abaris came from the Hyperborean regions,
in order that he might collect gold for the
temple, and that he predicted a pestilence. He
also dwelt in temples, and was never seen either to
eat or drink. It is likewise said, that rites which
purify from evil are performed by the Laced&aelig;monians,
and that on this account Laced&aelig;mon was
never infested with pestilence. Pythagoras, therefore,
caused this Abaris to acknowledge [that he
was more than man,] receiving from him at the
same time the golden dart, without which it was
not possible for him to find his way. In Metapontum
also, certain persons praying that they
might obtain what a ship contained that was
then sailing into port, Pythagoras said to them,
You will then have a dead body. In Sybaris,
too, he caught a deadly serpent and dismissed
it. In a similar manner likewise in Tyrrhenia,
he caught a small serpent, whose bite was fatal.
But in Crotona a white eagle, it is said, suffered
Pythagoras to stroke it. A certain person also
wishing to hear him discourse, he said that he
could not, till some sign appeared. And after this
<span class="pb" id="Page_103">103</span>
a white bear was seen in Cauconia; the death of
which he predicted to one who was about to tell him
that it was dead. He likewise reminded Myllias
the Crotonian that he had been Midas the son of
Gordius. And Myllias passed over to the continent
of Asia, in order to perform at the sepulchre
[of Midas] those rites which had been enjoined him
by Pythagoras. It is likewise said, that the person
who bought his house, and who dug up that which
had been buried in it, did not dare to tell any one
what he saw [on this occasion]. But instead of
suffering for this offence, he was seized at Crotona
for sacrilege, and put to death. For he took away
a golden beard which had fallen from a statue.
These things therefore, and others of the like kind,
are related by the Pythagoreans, in order to render
their opinions worthy of belief. And as these are
acknowledged to be true, and it is impossible they
should have happened to one man, they consequently
think it is clear, that what is related of Pythagoras,
should be received as pertaining to a
being superior to man, and not to a mere man.
This also is the meaning of their enigmatical assertion,
that <i>man, bird, and another third thing, are
bipeds</i>. For the third thing is Pythagoras. Such,
therefore, was Pythagoras on account of his piety,
and such he was truly thought to be.</p>
<p>With respect to oaths, however, all the Pythagoreans
religiously observe them, being mindful of
the Pythagoric precept,</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">First to th&rsquo; immortal Gods thy homage pay,</p>
<p class="t0">As they by law are orderly dispos&rsquo;d;</p>
<p class="t0">And reverence thy oath, but honor next</p>
<p class="t0">Th&rsquo; illustrious heroes.</p>
</div>
<p>Hence a certain Pythagorean, being compelled by
law to take an oath, yet in order that he might preserve
a Pythagoric dogma, though he would have
sworn religiously, chose instead of swearing to pay
three talents, this being the fine which he was condemned
to pay to the defendant. That Pythagoras
however thought that nothing was from chance
and fortune, but that all events happened conformably
to divine providence, and especially to good
and pious men, is confirmed by what is related by
Androcydes in his treatise on Pythagoric Symbols,
of Thymaridas the Tarentine, and a Pythagorean.
For when through a certain circumstance he was
about to sail from his own country, and his friends
who were present were embracing him, and bidding
him farewell, some one said to him, when he had
now ascended into the ship, May such things happen
to you from the Gods, O Thymaridas, as are
conformable to your wishes! But he replied, predict
better things; for I should rather wish that
such things may happen to me as are conformable
to the will of the Gods. For he thought it was
more scientific and equitable, not to resist or be
indignant with divine providence. If, therefore,
any one wishes to learn what were the sources
whence these men derived so much piety, it must
<span class="pb" id="Page_105">105</span>
be said, that a perspicuous paradigm of the Pythagoric
theology according to numbers, is in a certain
respect to be found in the writings of Orpheus.
Nor is it to be doubted, that Pythagoras receiving
auxiliaries from Orpheus, composed his treatise
Concerning the Gods, which on this account also
he inscribed the Sacred Discourse, because it contains
the flower of the most mystical place in Orpheus;
whether this work was in reality written by
Pythagoras, as by most authors it is said to have
been, or as some of the Pythagoric school who are
both learned and worthy of belief assert, was composed
by Telauges; being taken by him from the
commentaries which were left by Pythagoras himself
to his daughter Damo, the sister of Telauges,
and which it is said after her death were given to
Bitale the daughter of Damo, and to Telauges the
son of Pythagoras, and the husband of Bitale, when
he was of a mature age. For when Pythagoras
died, he was left very young with his mother
Theano. In this Sacred Discourse also, or treatise
concerning the Gods (for it has both these inscriptions),
who it was that delivered to Pythagoras
what is there said concerning the Gods, is rendered
manifest. For it says: &ldquo;<i>that Pythagoras the
son of Mnesarchus was instructed in what pertains
to the Gods, when he celebrated orgies in the Thracian
Libethra, being initiated in them by Aglaophemus;
and that Orpheus the son of Calliope,
<span class="pb" id="Page_106">106</span>
having learnt wisdom from his mother in the mountain
Pang&aelig;us, said, that
<a id="er19" href="#en19">the eternal essence of number is the most providential principle of the universe</a>,
of heaven and earth, and the intermediate
nature; and farther still, that it is the root of the
permanency of divine natures, of Gods and
d&aelig;mons</i>.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_35" href="#fn_35">[35]</a>
From these things, therefore, it is evident
<span class="pb" id="Page_107">107</span>
that he learnt from the Orphic writers that
the essence of the Gods is defined by number.
<i>Through the same numbers also, he produced an
admirable fore-knowledge and worship of the Gods,
both which are especially most allied to numbers.</i>
This, however, may be known from hence; for it
is necessary to adduce a certain fact, in order to
procure belief of what is said. When Abaris performed
sacred rites in his accustomed manner, he
procured a fore-knowledge of future events, which
is studiously cultivated by all the Barbarians,
through sacrificing animals, and especially birds;
for they are of opinion that the viscera of such
animals are subservient to a more accurate inspection.
Pythagoras, therefore, not wishing to suppress
his ardent pursuit of truth, but to impart it to
him through a certain safer way, and without blood
and slaughter, and also because he thought that a
cock was sacred to the sun, <i>furnished him with a
consummate knowledge of all truth, as it is said,
through the arithmetical science</i>. He also obtained
from piety, faith concerning the Gods.
For
<a id="er20" href="#en20">Pythagoras always proclaimed, that nothing admirable pertaining to the Gods or divine dogmas should be disbelieved</a>,
because the Gods are able
to accomplish all things. And the divine dogmas
<span class="pb" id="Page_108">108</span>
in which it is requisite to believe, are those which
Pythagoras delivered. Thus, therefore, the Pythagoreans
believed in, and assumed the things about
which they dogmatised, because they were not the
progeny of false opinion. Hence Eurytus the
Crotonian, the auditor of Philolaus said, that a
shepherd feeding his sheep near the tomb of Philolaus,
heard some one singing. But the person to
whom this was related, did not at all disbelieve the
narration, but asked what kind of harmony it was.
Pythagoras himself, also, being asked by a certain
person what was indicated by seeming in sleep to
converse with his father who was dead, answered
that it indicated nothing. For neither, said he, is
any thing portended by your speaking with me.</p>
<p>Pythagoras likewise used pure and white garments,
and in a similar manner white and pure
coverlids; for he did not use those that were made
of wool. And this custom he also delivered to his
auditors. In speaking also of the natures superior
to man, he employed honorable appellations, and
words of good omen, and upon every occasion
made mention of and reverenced the Gods; so
that while at supper, he performed libations to the
divinities, and ordered his disciples to celebrate
with hymns the beings that are above us, every
day. He paid attention likewise to rumors and
omens, prophecies and lots, and in short, to all
casual circumstances. Moreover, he sacrificed to
the Gods with millet, cakes, honey-combs, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_109">109</span>
other fumigations. But he did not sacrifice animals,
nor did any one of the contemplative philosophers.
His other disciples, however, viz. the
acusmatici, and the politici, were ordered by him
to sacrifice animals, such as a cock, or a lamb, or
some other animal recently born, but not frequently.
At the same time they were prohibited
from sacrificing oxen. This also is an indication
of the honor which he paid to the Gods, that he
exhorted his disciples never to employ the names
of the Gods uselessly in swearing. On which account
also Syllus, one of the Pythagoreans in Crotona,
paid a fine for not swearing, though he could
have sworn without violating truth. An oath too
such as the following is ascribed to the Pythagoreans,
as they were unwilling, through reverence,
to name Pythagoras; just as they very much abstained
from using the names of the Gods. But
they manifested the man through the invention of
the tetractys,</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0"><a id="er21" href="#en21">I swear by him who the tetractys found</a>,</p>
<p class="t0">Whence all our wisdom springs, and which contains</p>
<p class="t0">Perennial Nature&rsquo;s fountain, cause, and root.</p>
</div>
<p>And, in short, it is said that Pythagoras was emulous
of the Orphic mode of writing and [piety of]
disposition; and that he honored the Gods in a
way similar to that of Orpheus, placing them in
images and in brass, not conjoined to our forms,
<span class="pb" id="Page_110">110</span>
but to divine receptacles;<a class="fn" id="fr_36" href="#fn_36">[36]</a> because they comprehend
and provide for all things; and have a nature
and morphe similar to the universe. He also promulgated
purifications, and initiations as they are
called, which contain the most accurate knowledge
of the Gods. And farther still, it is said, that he
was the author of a compound divine philosophy
and worship of the Gods; having learnt indeed
some things from the followers of Orpheus, but
others from the Egyptian priests; some from the
Chald&aelig;ans and Magi; some from the mysteries
performed in Eleusis, in Imbrus, Samothracia, and
Delos; and some also from those which are performed
by the Celt&aelig;, and in Iberia. It is also
said that the Sacred Discourse of Pythagoras is
extant among the Latins, and is read not to all, nor
by all of them, but by those who are promptly disposed
<span class="pb" id="Page_111">111</span>
to learn what is excellent, and apply themselves
to nothing base. He likewise ordained that
men should make libations thrice, and observed that
Apollo delivered oracles from the tripod, because
the triad is the first number. That sacrifices also
should be made to Venus on the sixth day, because
<a id="er22" href="#en22">this number is the first that partakes of every number</a>,
and, when divided in every possible way, receives
the power of the numbers subtracted and of
those that remain. But that it is necessary to sacrifice
to Hercules on the eighth day of the month
from the beginning, looking in so doing to his being
born in the seventh month. He further asserted,
that it was necessary that he who entered a temple
should be clothed with a pure garment, and in
which no one had slept; because sleep in the same
manner as the black and the brown, is an indication
of sluggishness; but purity is a sign of equality
and justice in reasoning. He also ordered, that if
blood should be found involuntarily spilt in a temple,
a lustration should be made, either in a golden
vessel, or with the water of the sea; the former of
these [i.&nbsp;e. gold] being the most beautiful of things,
and a measure by which the price of all things is
regulated; but the latter as he conceived being the
progeny of a moist nature, and the nutriment of
the first and more common matter. He likewise
said, that it was not proper to bring forth children
in a temple; because it is not holy that in a temple
the divine part of the soul should be bound to the
<span class="pb" id="Page_112">112</span>
body. He further ordained, that on a festive day
neither the hair should be cut, nor the nails paired;
not thinking it fit that we should leave the service
of the Gods for the purpose of increasing our good.
He also said, that a louse ought not to be killed in a
temple; conceiving that a divine power ought not
to participate of any thing superfluous and corruptible.
But that the Gods should be honored with
cedar, laurel, cypress, oak, and myrtle; and that
the body should not be purified with these, nor
should any of them be divided by the teeth. He
likewise ordained, that what is boiled should not be
roasted; signifying by this that mildness is not in
want of anger. But he would not suffer the bodies
of the dead to be burned; following in this the
Magi, being unwilling that any thing divine should
communicate with a mortal nature. He likewise
thought it was holy for the dead to be carried out
in white garments; obscurely signifying by this the
simple and first nature, according to number and
the principle of all things. But above all things
he ordained, that an oath should be taken religiously;
since that which is behind is long.<a class="fn" id="fr_37" href="#fn_37">[37]</a> And
he said, that it is much more holy to be injured than
to kill a man: for judgment is deposited in Hades,
where the soul and its essence, and the first nature
<span class="pb" id="Page_113">113</span>
of things are [properly] estimated. Farther still,
he ordered that sepulchral chests [i.&nbsp;e. biers] should
not be made of cypress, because the sceptre of Jupiter
was made of this wood, or for some other mystic
reason. He likewise ordained that libations should
be performed before the table of Jupiter the Saviour,
and of Hercules and the Dioscuri; in so
doing celebrating Jupiter as the presiding cause
and leader of this nutriment; Hercules, as the
power of nature; and the Dioscuri, as the symphony
of all things. But he said, that libations
should not be offered with closed eyes. For he
did not think it fit, that any thing beautiful should
be undertaken with shame and bashfulness. Moreover,
when it thundered, he ordained that the earth
should be touched, in remembrance of the generation
of things. But he ordered that temples should
be entered from places on the right hand, and that
they should be departed out of from the left hand.
For he asserted that the right hand is the principle
of what is called the odd number, and is divine;
but that the left hand is a symbol of the even number,
and of that which is dissolved. And such is
the mode which he is said to have adopted in the
cultivation of piety. But other particulars which
we have omitted concerning it, may be conjectured
from what has been said. So that I shall cease to
speak further on this subject.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<h3 id="c29">CHAP. XXIX.</h3>
<p>Of his wisdom, however, the commentaries
written by the Pythagoreans afford, in short, the
greatest indication; for they adhere to truth in every
thing, and are more concise than all other compositions,
so that they savour of the ancient elegance
of style, and the conclusions are exquisitely deduced
with divine science. They are also replete
with the most condensed conceptions, and are in
other respects various and diversified both in the
form and the matter. At one and the same time
likewise, they are transcendently excellent, and
without any deficiency in the diction, and are in an
eminent degree full of clear and indubitable arguments,
accompanied with scientific demonstration,
and as it is said, the most perfect syllogism; as he
will find to be the case, who, proceeding in such
paths as are fit, does not negligently peruse them.
This science, therefore, concerning intelligible natures
and the Gods, Pythagoras delivers in his
writings from a supernal origin. Afterwards, he
teaches the whole of physics, and unfolds completely
ethical philosophy and logic. He likewise
<span class="pb" id="Page_115">115</span>
delivers all-various disciplines, and the most excellent
sciences. And in short there is nothing pertaining
to human knowledge which is not accurately
discussed in these writings. If therefore it
is acknowledged, that of the [Pythagoric] writings
which are now in circulation, some were written by
Pythagoras himself, but others consist of what he
was heard to say, and on this account are anonymous,
but are referred to Pythagoras as their author;&mdash;if
this be the case, it is evident that he was
abundantly skilled in all wisdom. But it is said
that he very much applied himself to geometry
among the Egyptians. For with the Egyptians
there are many geometrical problems; since it is
necessary that from remote periods, and from the
time of the Gods themselves,<a class="fn" id="fr_38" href="#fn_38">[38]</a> on account of the
increments and decrements of the Nile, those that
were skilful should have measured all the Egyptian
land which they cultivated. Hence also geometry
derived its name. Neither did they negligently
investigate the theory of the celestial orbs, in which
likewise Pythagoras was skilled. Moreover, all the
theorems about lines appear to have been derived
from thence. For it is said that what pertains to
computation and numbers, was discovered in Ph&oelig;nicia.
For some persons refer the theorems about
<span class="pb" id="Page_116">116</span>
the celestial bodies to the Egyptians and Chaldeans
in common. It is said therefore, that Pythagoras
having received and increased all these [theories,]
imparted the sciences, and at the same time demonstrated
them to his auditors with perspicuity
and elegance. And he was the first indeed that
denominated philosophy, and said that it was the
desire, and as it were love of wisdom. But he defined
wisdom to be the science of the truth which is
in beings. And he said that beings are immaterial
and eternal natures, and alone possess an efficacious
power, such as incorporeal essences. But
that the rest of things are only homonymously
beings, and are so denominated through the participation
of real beings, and such are corporeal and
material forms, which are generated and corrupted,
and never truly are. And that wisdom is the
science of things which are properly beings, but not
of such as are homonymously so. For corporeal
natures are neither the objects of science nor admit
of a stable knowledge, since they are infinite and
incomprehensible by science, and are as it were,
non-beings, when compared with universals, and
are incapable of being properly circumscribed by
definition. It is impossible however to conceive
that there should be science of things which are not
naturally the objects of science. Hence it is not
probable that there will be a desire of science which
has no subsistence, but rather that desire will be
<span class="pb" id="Page_117">117</span>
extended to things which are properly beings,
which exist with invariable permanency, and are
always consubsistent with a true appellation. For
it happens that the perception of things which are
homonymously beings, and which are never truly
what they seem to be, follows the apprehension of
real beings; just as the knowledge of particulars
follows the science of universals. For he who
knows universals properly, says Archytas, will also
have a clear perception of the nature of particulars.
Hence things which have an existence are not
alone, nor only-begotten, nor simple, but they are
seen to be various and multiform. For some of
them are intelligible and incorporeal natures, and
which are denominated beings; but others are corporeal
and fall under the perception of sense, and
by participation communicate with that which has
a real existence. Concerning all these therefore,
he delivered the most appropriate sciences, and
left nothing [pertaining to them] uninvestigated.
<i>He likewise unfolded to men those sciences which
are common</i> [<i>to all disciplines</i>,] as for instance the
demonstrative, the definitive, and that which consists
in dividing, as may be known from the Pythagoric
commentaries. He was also accustomed to
pour forth sentences resembling Oracles to his familiars
in a symbolical manner, and which in the
greatest brevity of words contained the most abundant
and multifarious meaning, like the Pythian
<span class="pb" id="Page_118">118</span>
Apollo through certain oracles, or like nature herself
through seeds small in bulk, the former exhibiting
conceptions, and the latter effects, innumerable
in multitude, and difficult to be understood.
Of this kind is the sentence, <i>The beginning
is the half of the whole</i>, which is an apothegm of
Pythagoras himself. But not only in the present
hemistich, but in others of a similar nature, the most
divine Pythagoras has concealed the sparks of
truth; depositing as in a treasury for those who are
capable of being enkindled by them, and with a
certain brevity of diction, an extension of theory
most ample and difficult to be comprehended, as in
the following hemistich:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">All things accord in number:</p>
</div>
<p>which he very frequently uttered to all his disciples.
Or again, <i>Friendship is equality; equality
is friendship</i>. Or in the word <i>cosmos</i>, i.&nbsp;e. <i>the
world</i>; or by Jupiter, in the word <i>philosophy</i>, or
in the so much celebrated word <i>tetractys</i>. All
these and many other inventions of the like kind,
were devised by Pythagoras for the benefit and
amendment of his associates; and they were considered
by those that understood them to be so venerable,
and so much the progeny of divine inspiration,
that the following was adopted as an oath by
those that dwelt together in the common auditory:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">I swear by him who the tetractys found,</p>
<p class="t0">And to our race reveal&rsquo;d; the cause and root,</p>
<p class="t0">And fount of ever-flowing Nature.</p>
</div>
<p>This therefore was the form of his wisdom which is
so admirable.</p>
<p>It is also said, that of the sciences which the Pythagoreans
honored, music, medicine and divination,
were not among the least. But they were habitually
silent and prompt to hear, and he who was
able to hear [in a proper manner] was praised by
them. Of medicine, however, they especially embraced
the di&aelig;tetic species, and in the exercise of
this were most accurate. And in the first place,
indeed, they endeavoured to learn the indications
of symmetry, of labor, food, and repose. In the
next place, with respect to the preparation of food,
they were nearly the first who attempted to employ
themselves in it, and to define the mode in which
it should be performed. The Pythagoreans likewise
employed cataplasms more frequently than
their predecessors; but they in a less degree approved
of medicated ointments. These however
they principally used in the cure of ulcerations.
But incisions and burnings they admitted the least
of all things. Some diseases also they cured by
incantations. Pythagoras, however, thought that
music greatly contributed to health, if it was used
in a proper manner. The Pythagoreans likewise
employed select sentences of Homer and Hesiod
<span class="pb" id="Page_120">120</span>
for the amendment of souls. But they thought
it was necessary to retain and preserve in the memory
things which they had learnt and heard; and
that it was requisite to be furnished with disciplines
and auditions, to as great an extent as there was an
ability of learning and remembering; the former
of these being the power by which knowledge is obtained,
but the latter, the power by which it is preserved.
Hence, they very much honored the memory,
abundantly exercised, and paid great attention
to it. In learning too, they did not dismiss
what they were taught, till they had firmly comprehended
the first rudiments of it; and they recalled
to their memory what they had daily heard, after
the following manner: A Pythagorean never rose
from his bed till he had first recollected the transactions
of the former day; and he accomplished
this by endeavouring to remember what he first
said, or heard, or ordered his domestics to do when
he was rising, or what was the second and third
thing which he said, heard, or commanded to be
done. And the same method was adopted with respect
to the remainder of the day. For again, he
endeavoured to recollect who was the first person
that he met, on leaving his house, or who was the
second; and with whom he in the first, or second,
or third place discoursed. And after the same
manner he proceeded in other things. For he endeavoured
to resume in his memory all the events
<span class="pb" id="Page_121">121</span>
of the whole day, and in the very same order in
which each of them happened to take place. But
if they had sufficient leisure after rising from sleep,
they tried after the same manner to recollect the
events of the third preceding day. And thus they
endeavoured to exercise the memory to a great
extent. For there is not any thing which is of
greater importance with respect to science, experience
and wisdom, than the ability of remembering.
From these studies therefore, it happened that all
Italy was filled with philosophers, and this place,
which before was unknown, was afterwards on account
of Pythagoras called Magna Gr&aelig;cia.
Hence also it contained many philosophers, poets,
and legislators. For the rhetorical arts, demonstrative
reasonings, and the laws written by them,
were transferred from Italy to Greece. Those
likewise who make mention of physics, adduce as
the principal physiologists Empedocles and the
Elean Parmenides. Those too, who wish to cite
sentences, pertaining to the conduct of human life,
adduce for this purpose the conceptions of Epicharmus.
And nearly all philosophers make use of
these. Thus much therefore concerning the wisdom
of Pythagoras, how in a certain respect he
very much impelled all his auditors to the pursuit
of it, as far as they were adapted to its participation,
and how perfectly it was delivered by him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<h3 id="c30">CHAP. XXX.</h3>
<p>With respect to justice, however, we shall learn
in the best manner, how he cultivated and delivered
it to mankind, if we survey it from its first principle,
and from what first causes it germinates, and
also direct our attention to the first cause of injustice.
For thus we shall discover how he avoided
the latter, and what methods he adopted in order
that the former might be properly ingenerated in
the soul. The principle of justice therefore, is
the common and the equal, through which, in a way
most nearly approximating to one body and one
soul, all men may be co-passive, and may call the
same thing mine and thine; as is also testified by
Plato, who learnt this from the Pythagoreans.
This therefore, Pythagoras effected in the best
manner, exterminating every thing private in manners,
but increasing that which is common as far as
to ultimate possessions, which are the causes of
sedition and tumult. For all things [with his disciples]
were common and the same to all, and no
one possessed any thing private. And he indeed,
who approved of this communion, used common
<span class="pb" id="Page_123">123</span>
possessions in the most just manner; but he who
did not, received his own property, which he
brought to the common stock, with an addition to
it, and departed. And thus he established justice
in the best manner, from the first principle of it.</p>
<p>In the next place, therefore, association with men
introduces justice; but alienation, and a contempt
of the common genus, produce injustice. Wishing
therefore to insert this familiarity from afar in men,
he also ordained that his disciples should extend it
to animals of the same genus, and commanded
them to consider these as their familiars and
friends; so as neither to injure, nor slay, nor eat
any one of them. He therefore who associates men
with animals, because they consist of the same elements
as we do, and participate with us of a more
common life, will in a much greater degree establish
fellowship with those who partake of a soul of
the same species, and also of a rational soul. From
this also it is evident that he introduced justice produced
from the most proper principle. Since likewise
the want of riches, sometimes compels many
to do something contrary to justice, he well foresaw
that this would be the case, and through economy
procured for himself liberal expenses, and what was
just in sufficient abundance. For again, a just arrangement
of domestic concerns is the principle of
all good order in cities. For cities are constituted
from houses. It is said therefore, that Pythagoras
<span class="pb" id="Page_124">124</span>
himself was the heir of the property of Alc&aelig;us, who
died after performing an embassy to the Laced&aelig;monians,
but that notwithstanding this, he was no
less admired for his economy than for his philosophy.
When also he was married, he so educated
the daughter that was born to him, and who was
afterwards married to Meno the Crotonian, that
when she was a virgin she was the leader of choirs,
but when a wife she held the first place among
those that approached to altars. It is likewise
said, that the Metapontines preserving the remembrance
of Pythagoras after his time, made his house
a temple of Ceres, but the street in which he lived
a museum.</p>
<p>Because also insolence, luxury, and a contempt
of the laws, frequently impel men to injustice, on
this account he daily exhorted his disciples to give
assistance to law, and to be hostile to illegality.
Hence he made such a division as the following:
that what is called luxury, is the first evil that
usually glides into houses and cities; that the second
is insolence; and the third destruction.
That hence luxury should by all possible means be
excluded and expelled [from every house and city,]
and that men should be accustomed from their
birth to a temperate and manly life. He farther
added, that it is requisite to be purified from all
malediction, whether it be that which is lamentable,
or that which excites hostility, and whether
<span class="pb" id="Page_125">125</span>
it be of a reviling, or insolent, or scurrilous nature.</p>
<p>Besides these, likewise, he established another
most beautiful species of justice, viz. the legislative;
which orders indeed what ought to be
done; but forbids what ought not to be done.
This species, however, is more excellent than the
judicial form of justice. For it resembles medicine
which heals those that are diseased. It differs
from it however in this, that it does not suffer disease
to commence, but pays attention from afar to
the health of the soul. This therefore being the
case, the best of all legislators came from the school
of Pythagoras: in the first place, indeed, Charondas
the Catan&aelig;an; and in the next place, Zaleucus
and Timaratus, who wrote laws for the Locrians.
Besides these likewise there were The&aelig;tetus and
Helicaon, Aristocrates, and Phytius, who became
the legislators of the Rhegini. All these likewise
obtained from their citizens honors similar to
those of the Gods. For Pythagoras did not act
like Heraclitus, who said that he would write
laws for the Ephesians, and also petulantly<a class="fn" id="fr_39" href="#fn_39">[39]</a> said,
that in those laws he would order the citizens to
<span class="pb" id="Page_126">126</span>
hang themselves. But Pythagoras endeavoured
to establish laws, with great benevolence and political
science. Why however is it requisite to admire
these men? For Zamolxis being a Thracian,
and the slave of Pythagoras, after he had heard the
discourses of Pythagoras, having obtained his
liberty, and returned to Get&aelig;, gave laws to
them, as we have before observed in the beginning
of this work, and exhorted the citizens to fortitude,
<i>having persuaded them that the soul is immortal.
Hence even at present, all the Galat&aelig;, and Trallians,
and many others of the Barbarians, persuade
their children that the soul cannot be destroyed;
but that it remains after death, and that death is
not to be feared, but danger is to be encountered
with a firm and manly mind.</i> Having therefore instructed
the Get&aelig; in these things, and written laws
for them, he was considered by them as the greatest
of the Gods.</p>
<p>Farther still, he apprehended that the dominion
of the Gods was most efficacious to the establishment
of justice, and supernally from this he constituted
a polity and laws, and also justice. It will
not however be foreign to the purpose, to add particularly
the manner in which he thought we ought
to conceive of divinity; viz. that we should conceive
that he exists, and that he is so disposed towards
the human race, that be inspects and does
not neglect it. And this conception which the Pythagoreans
<span class="pb" id="Page_127">127</span>
derived from Pythagoras, they apprehended
to be of great utility. For we require an
inspection of this kind, which we do not in any
thing think fit to resist. But such as this is the inspective
government of divinity. Fop if a divine
nature is a thing of this kind, it deserves to have
the empire of the universe. For it was rightly said
by the Pythagoreans, that man is an animal [so far
as pertains to his irrational part,] naturally insolent,
and various, according to impulses, desires,
and the rest of the passions. He requires therefore
transcendent inspection and government of this
kind, from which a certain castigation and order
may be derived. Hence they thought that every
one being conscious of the variety of his nature,
should never he forgetful of piety towards, and the
worship of divinity; but should always place him
before the eye of the mind, as inspecting and diligently
observing the conduct of mankind. But
after divinity and the d&aelig;moniacal nature, they
thought that every one should pay the greatest
attention to his parents and the laws, and should
be obedient to them, not feignedly, but faithfully.
And universally, they thought it necessary to believe,
that nothing is a greater evil than anarchy;
since the human race is not naturally adapted to be
saved, when no one rules over it.</p>
<p>These men also thought it right to adhere to the
customs and legal institutes of their ancestors, even
<span class="pb" id="Page_128">128</span>
though they should be somewhat inferior to other
customs and laws. For to fly from the existing
laws, and to be studious of innovation, is by no
means profitable and salutary. Pythagoras therefore
gave many other specimens of piety to the
Gods, evincing that his life was conformable to his
doctrines. Nor will it be foreign to the purpose
to mention one of them, which may serve to elucidate
the rest. But I will relate what Pythagoras
said and did relative to the embassy from Sybaris
to Crotona, about demanding the return of the
exiles. For some of his associates were slain by
order of the ambassadors, one of whom slew a part
of them with his own hands; but another was the
son of one of those who had excited the sedition,
and who died through disease. When the Crotonians
therefore were deliberating how they should
act in this affair, Pythagoras said to his disciples,
that he was not willing the Crotonians should be
so greatly discordant in this affair, and that in his
opinion, the ambassadors should not even lead victims
to the altars, much less ought they to drag
suppliants [i.&nbsp;e. the exiles] from them. But when
the Sybarites came to him with their complaints,
and the man who had slain some of his associates
with his own hands, was defending his conduct,
Pythagoras said, that he should not answer [an homicide].
Hence, some persons accused him of
asserting that he was Apollo, because prior to this
<span class="pb" id="Page_129">129</span>
some one having asked him about a certain object
of inquiry, why the thing was so; he in his turn
asked the interrogator, if he would think fit to inquire
of Apollo when he was delivering oracles to
him, why he delivered them? But to another of
the ambassadors who appeared to him to deride his
school, in which he taught the return of souls to the
supernal realms, and who said that he would give
him an epistle to his father, as he was about to
descend into Hades, and exhorted him to bring
another letter in answer, from his father, when he
returned; Pythagoras replied, that he was not
about to descend into the abode of the impious,
where he clearly knew that murderers were punished.
But the ambassadors reviling him, he proceeded
to the sea, many persons following him,
and there sprinkled himself with marine water.
Some one however of the Crotonian counsellors,
after reviling the rest of the ambassadors, observed
that he understood they had defamed Pythagoras,
whom not even a brute would dare to blaspheme,
though all animals should again utter the same
voice as men, which fables report they did in the
beginning of things.</p>
<p>Pythagoras likewise discovered another method
of restraining men from injustice, through the judgment
of souls, truly knowing indeed that this method
may be taught, and also knowing that it is
useful to the suppression of justice through fear.
<span class="pb" id="Page_130">130</span>
He asserted therefore, that it is much better to be
injured than to kill a man; for that judgment is
deposited in Hades, where the soul, and its essence,
and the first nature of beings, are properly estimated.
Being desirous, however, to exhibit in
things unequal, without symmetry and infinite, a
definite, equal, and commensurate justice, and to
show how it ought to be exercised, he said, that
justice resembles that figure, which is the only one
among geometrical diagrams, that having indeed
infinite compositions of figures, but dissimilarly
disposed with reference to each other, yet has equal
demonstrations of power.<a class="fn" id="fr_40" href="#fn_40">[40]</a> Since also, there is a
certain justice in making use of another person,
such a mode of it as the following, is said to have
been delivered by the Pythagoreans: Of associations
with others, one kind is seasonable, but another is
unseasonable. These likewise are distinguished
from each other by difference of age, desert, the
familiarity of alliance, and of beneficence, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_131">131</span>
whatever else there may be of the like kind in the
different associations of men with each other. For
there is a species of association, viz. of a younger
with a younger person, which does not appear to
be unseasonable; but that of a younger with an
elderly person is unseasonable. For no species of
anger, or threatening, or boldness, is becoming in a
younger towards an elderly man, but all unseasonable
conduct of this kind should be cautiously
avoided. A similar reasoning likewise should be
adopted with respect to desert. For it is neither
decorous, nor seasonable, to use an unrestrained
freedom of speech, or to adopt any of the above-mentioned
modes of conduct, towards a man who
has arrived at the true dignity of consummate
virtue. Conformably to this also, was what he
said respecting the association with parents, and
likewise with benefactors. He added, that there
is a certain various and multiform use of an opportune
time. For of those that are enraged and
angry, some are so seasonably, but others unseasonably.
And again, of those that aspire after, desire,
and are impelled to any thing appetible, an
opportune time is the attendant on some, and an
unseasonable time on others. And the same thing
may be said concerning other passions and actions,
dispositions, associations, and meetings. He farther
observed, that an opportune time is <i>to a certain
extent</i>, to be taught, and also, that what happens
<span class="pb" id="Page_132">132</span>
contrary to expectation, is capable of receiving
an artificial discussion; but that when it is considered
universally and simply, none of the above-mentioned
particulars pertain to it. Nearly, however,
such things are the attendants on it, as follow
the nature of opportune time, viz. what is called
the florid, the becoming, the adapted, and whatever
else there may be homogeneous to these. He likewise
asserted, that principle [or the beginning] is in
the universe unity, and is the most honorable of
things; and that in a similar manner it is so in
science, in experience, and in generation. And
again, that the number two is most honorable in a
house, in a city, in a camp, and in all such like
systems. But that the nature of principle is difficult
to be surveyed and apprehended in all the
above-mentioned particulars. For in sciences, it is
not the province of any casual understanding to
learn and judge, by well surveying the parts of
things, what the nature is of the principle of these.
He added, that it makes a great difference, and
that there is danger with respect to the knowledge
of the whole of things, when principle is not rightly
assumed. For none, in short, of the consequent
conclusions can be sane, when the true principle is
unknown. The same thing may also be said respecting
a principle of another kind. For neither
can a house, or a city, be well instituted, unless
each has a true ruler, who governs those that
<span class="pb" id="Page_133">133</span>
voluntarily submit to him. For it is necessary that
in both these the governor should be willing to
rule, and the governed to obey. Just as with respect
to disciplines, when they are taught with proper
effect, it is necessary that there should be a
concurrence in the will both of the teacher and
learner. For if there is a resistance on the part of
either, the proposed work will never be accomplished
in a proper manner. Thus therefore, he
proved, that it was beautiful to be persuaded by
rulers, and to be obedient to preceptors. But he
exhibited the following as the greatest argument
through deeds, of the truth of his observations. He
went from Italy to Delos, to Pherecydes the Syrian,
who had been his preceptor, in order that he
might afford him some assistance, as he was then
afflicted with what is called the morbus pedicularis,
and he carefully attended him to the time of his
death, and piously performed whatever rites were
due to his dead preceptor. So diligent was he in
the discharge of his duties to him from whom he
had received instruction.</p>
<p>Moreover, with respect to compacts and the veracity
pertaining to them, Pythagoras so prepared
his disciples for the observance of them, that, as it
is said, Lysis having once performed his adorations
in the temple of Juno, met, as he was departing
from it, about the vestibules with Euryphamus the
Syracusan, who was one of his fellow disciples, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_134">134</span>
was then entering into the temple. Euryphamus
therefore desiring Lysis to wait for him, till he also
had adored the Goddess, Lysis sat down on a
stone seat which was placed there. Euryphamus
however having finished his adoration, and becoming
absorbed in certain profound conceptions, forgot
his appointment, and went out of the temple
through another gate. But Lysis waited for him
without quitting his seat, the remainder of that day
and the following night, and also the greater part of
the next day. And perhaps he would have staid
there for a still longer time, unless Euryphamus on
the following day, had heard in the auditory, that
Lysis was wanted by his associates. Recollecting
therefore his compact, he came to Lysis, and liberated
him from his engagement, at the same time
telling him the cause of his forgetfulness, and
added, &ldquo;Some God produced in me this oblivion,
as a trial of your firmness in preserving your compacts.&rdquo;
Pythagoras likewise ordained abstinence
from animal food, for many other reasons, and likewise
because it is productive of peace. For those
who are accustomed to abominate the slaughter of
animals as iniquitous and preternatural, will think
it to be much more unlawful to kill a man, or
engage in war. But war is the leader and legislator
of slaughter. For by this it is increased, and
becomes strong and powerful.
<a id="er23" href="#en23">Not to step also above the beam of the balance</a>, is an exhortation to
<span class="pb" id="Page_135">135</span>
justice, announcing, that whatever is just should be
cultivated, as will be shown when we discuss the
Pythagoric symbols. It appears therefore, through
all these particulars, that Pythagoras paid great
attention to the exercise of justice, and to the delivery
of it to mankind, both in deeds and in words.</p>
<h3 id="c31">CHAP. XXXI.</h3>
<p>It follows, in the next place, that we should
speak of temperance, and show how it was cultivated
by Pythagoras, and how he delivered it to
his associates. We have already therefore narrated
the common precepts concerning it, in which it is
said that every thing incommensurate should be cut
off with fire and sword. The abstinence also from
animal food, is a precept of the same species; and
likewise from certain foods calculated to produce
intemperance, and impeding the vigilance and
genuine energies of the reasoning power. Farther
still, to this species the precept belongs, that sumptuous
food should indeed be introduced in banquets,
but should [shortly after] be sent away, and
given to the servants, being placed on the table
<span class="pb" id="Page_136">136</span>
merely for the sake of punishing the desires. Likewise,
that no liberal and ingenuous woman should
wear gold, but only harlots. And again, the exercise
of taciturnity, and perfect silence, for the purpose
of governing the tongue. Likewise a strenuous
and assiduous resumption and investigation of the
most difficult theorems. But on account of all
these, we must refer to the same virtue [i.&nbsp;e. to temperance,]
abstinence from wine; paucity of food and
sleep; an inartificial contempt of renown, wealth,
and the like; a sincere reverence towards those to
whom reverence is due, but an unfeigned similitude
of behaviour and benevolence towards those of
the same age; an animadversion and exhortation
of those that are younger, without envy; and every
thing else of the like kind.</p>
<p>The temperance also of those men, and how
Pythagoras taught this virtue, may be learnt from
what Hippobotus and Neanthes narrate of Myllias
and Timycha who were Pythagoreans. For they
say that Dionysius the tyrant could not obtain the
friendship of any one of the Pythagoreans, though
he did every thing to accomplish his purpose; for
they had observed, and carefully avoided his monarchical
disposition. He sent therefore to the
Pythagoreans, a troop of thirty soldiers, under the
command of Eurymenes the Syracusan, who was
the brother of Dion, in order that by treachery
their accustomed migration from Tarentum to Metapontum,
<span class="pb" id="Page_137">137</span>
might be opportunely effected for his
purpose. For it was usual with them to change
their abode at different seasons of the year, and
they chose such places as were adapted to this migration.
In Phal&aelig; therefore, a craggy part of Tarentum,
through which the Pythagoreans must
necessarily pass in their journey, Eurymenes insidiously
concealed his troop, and when the Pythagoreans,
expecting no such thing, came to that place
about the middle of the day, the soldiers rushed
upon them with shouts, after the manner of robbers.
But the Pythagoreans being disturbed and terrified
at an attack so unexpected, and at the superior
number of their enemies (for the whole number of
the Pythagoreans was but ten), and considering also
that they must be taken captive, as they were without
arms, and had to contend with men who were
variously armed,&mdash;they found that their only safety
was in flight, and they did not conceive that this
was foreign to virtue. For they knew that fortitude,
according to the decision of right reason, is
the science of things which are to be avoided and
endured. And this they now obtained. For those
who were with Eurymenes, being heavy-armed,
would have abandoned the pursuit of the Pythagoreans,
if the latter in their flight had not arrived at
a certain field sown with beans, and which were in
a sufficiently florishing condition. Not being willing
therefore to violate the dogma which ordered
<span class="pb" id="Page_138">138</span>
them not to touch beans, they stood still, and from
necessity attacked their pursuers with stones and
sticks, and whatever else they happened to meet
with, till they had slain some, and wounded many
of them. All the Pythagoreans however, were
at length slain by the spearmen, nor would any one
of them suffer himself to be taken captive, but preferred
death to this, conformably to the mandates
of their sect.</p>
<p>Eurymenes therefore, and his soldiers, were beyond
measure disturbed on finding that they should
not be able to bring one of the Pythagoreans alive
to Dionysius, though they were sent by him for
this purpose alone. Hence, having piled earth on
the slain, and buried them in that place in a common
sepulchre, they turned their steps homeward.
As they were returning, however, they happened to
meet with Myllias the Crotonian, and his wife
Timycha the Laced&aelig;monian, whom the other Pythagoreans
had left behind, because Timycha being
pregnant, was now in her sixth<a class="fn" id="fr_41" href="#fn_41">[41]</a> month, and on this
account walked leisurely. These therefore, the
soldiers gladly made captive, and led them to the
tyrant, paying every attention to them, in order that
<span class="pb" id="Page_139">139</span>
they might be brought to him safe. But the tyrant
having learnt what had happened, was greatly dejected,
and said to the two Pythagoreans, You
shall obtain from me honors transcending all others
in dignity, if you will consent to reign in conjunction
with me. All his offers however being rejected
by Myllias and Timycha; If then, said he, you will
only teach me one thing, I will dismiss you with a
sufficiently safe guard. Myllias therefore asking
him what it was he wished to learn; Dionysius replied,
It is this, why your companions chose rather
to die, than to tread on beans? But Myllias immediately
answered, My companions indeed submitted
to death, in order that they might not tread
upon beans, but I would rather tread on them,
than tell you the cause of this. Dionysius therefore,
being astonished at this answer, ordered him
to be forcibly taken away, but commanded Timycha
to be tortured: for he thought, that as she was
a woman, pregnant, and deprived of her husband,
she would easily tell him what he wanted to know,
through fear of the torments. The heroic woman,
however, grinding her tongue with her teeth, bit it
off, and spit it at the tyrant; evincing by this, that
though her sex being vanquished by the torments
might be compelled to disclose something which
ought to be concealed in silence, yet the member
subservient to the developement of it, should be
entirely cut off. So much difficulty did they make
<span class="pb" id="Page_140">140</span>
in admitting foreign friendships, even though they
should happen to be royal.</p>
<p>Similar to these also, were the precepts concerning
silence, and which tended to the exercise of
temperance. For the subjugation of the tongue,
is of all other continence the most difficult. The
persuading likewise the Crotonians to abstain from
the profane and spurious association with harlots,
pertains to the same virtue. And besides this, the
correction through music, by means of which Pythagoras
restored a young man to temperance, who
had become furious through love. The exhortation
also, which leads from lascivious insolence, must be
referred to the same virtue. And these things
Pythagoras delivered to the Pythagoreans, he himself
being the cause of them. For they so attended
to their bodies, that they might always remain in
the same condition, and not at one time be lean,
but at another, abounding in flesh. For they considered
this to be an indication of an anomalous
life. In a similar manner also with respect to the
mind, they were careful that they might not be at
one time cheerful, and at another sad, but that they
might be mildly joyful with uniformity. But they
expelled rage, despondency, and perturbation.
<i>And it was a precept with them, that no human
casualties ought to be unexpected by those who are
endued with intellect, but that they should expect
every thing may happen which it is not in their
<span class="pb" id="Page_141">141</span>
power to prevent.</i> But if at any time they were in
a rage, or oppressed with sorrow, or any thing else
of this kind, they separated themselves from the
rest of their associates, and each by himself alone,
endeavoured to digest and heal the passion.</p>
<p>This also is said of the Pythagoreans, that no
one of them when angry, either punished a servant,
or admonished any free man, but each of them
waited till his mind was restored to its former [tranquil]
condition. But they called <i>to admonish</i>, <i>p&aelig;dartan</i>.
For they accomplished this waiting by
employing silence and quiet. Hence Spintharus
relates of Archytas the Tarentine, that returning
after a certain time from the war which the city of
Tarentum waged against the Messenians, to inspect
some land which belonged to him, and finding that
the bailiff and the other servants, had not paid
proper attention to the cultivation of it, but had
greatly neglected it, being enraged, he was so indignant,
that he told his servants it was well for them
he was angry; since, if this had not happened, they
would not have escaped the punishment due to so
great an offence. Spintharus likewise says that a
similar thing is related of Clinias. For he also
deferred all admonitions and punishments, till his
mind was restored to tranquillity.</p>
<p>It is farther related of the Pythagoreans, that
they expelled from themselves lamentation, weeping,
and every thing else of this kind; and that
<span class="pb" id="Page_142">142</span>
neither gain, nor desire, nor anger, nor ambition,
nor any thing of a similar nature, became the cause
of dissension among them; but that all the Pythagoreans
were so disposed towards each other, as a
worthy father is towards his offspring. This also
is a beautiful circumstance, that they referred every
thing to Pythagoras, and called it by his name,
and that they did not ascribe to themselves the
glory of their own inventions, except very rarely.
For there are very few whose works are acknowledged
to be their own. The accuracy too, with
which they preserved their writings is admirable.
For in so many ages, no one appears to have met
with any of the commentaries of the Pythagoreans,
prior to the time of Philolaus. But he first published
those three celebrated books, which Dion
the Syracusan is said to have bought, at the request
of Plato, for a hundred mina. For Philolaus
had fallen into a certain great and severe poverty;
and from his alliance to the Pythagoreans,
was a partaker of their writings.</p>
<p>With respect also to opinion,<a class="fn" id="fr_42" href="#fn_42">[42]</a> it is related that
they spoke of it as follows: That it is the province
of a stupid man to pay attention to the opinion of
every one, and especially to that of the multitude.
<span class="pb" id="Page_143">143</span>
Far it belongs to a few only to apprehend and
opine rightly; since it is evident that this pertains to
the intelligent alone. But they are few. It is manifest
therefore, that a power of this kind does not
extend itself to the multitude. But it is also stupid
to despise the opinion of every one. For it will
happen that he who is so disposed will be unlearned
and incorrigible. It is however necessary that he
who is destitute of science should learn those things
of which he is ignorant, and has no scientific
knowledge. And it is likewise necessary that the
learner should pay attention to the opinion of him
who possesses science, and is able to teach. And
universally, it is necessary that those young men
who wish to be saved, should attend to the opinion
of their elders, and of those who have lived well.
But in the whole of human life there are certain
ages (denominated by them as it is said <i>endedasmen&aelig;</i>)
which it is not in the power of any casual
person to connect with each other. For they are
expelled by each other, unless some one conducts
a man from his birth, in a beautiful and upright
manner. It is necessary therefore, when a child is
educated well, and is formed to temperance and
fortitude, that a great part of his education should
be given to the age of adolescence [which is that of
a lad]. In a similar manner also, when a lad is
formed to temperance and fortitude, it is necessary
that a great part of his education should be transferred
<span class="pb" id="Page_144">144</span>
to the age of manhood. For that which
happens to the multitude is absurd and ridiculous.
For they fancy it is requisite that boys should be
orderly and temperate, and should abstain from
every thing which appears to be troublesome and
indecorous; but that when they have arrived at
adolescency, they may for the most part do whatever
they please. Hence there is nearly a conflux
of both kinds of errors into this age. For lads
commit many faults which are both puerile and
virile. For, in short, to avoid every kind of sedulity
and order, and to pursue every species of sport,
and puerile intemperance and insolence, are most
adapted to the age of a boy. Such a disposition
therefore as this, is derived from the puerile into
the following age. But the genus of strong desires,
and of different species of ambition, and in a similar
manner the remaining impulses and dispositions,
when they are of a severe and turbulent nature,
are derived from the virile age into that of adolescency.
Hence this of all the ages demands the
greatest attention. And universally, no man ought
to be suffered to do whatever he pleases, but it is
always necessary that there should be a certain inspection,
and a legal and elegantly-formed government,
to which each of the citizens is obedient.
For the animal, when left to itself and neglected,
rapidly degenerates into vice and depravity.</p>
<p>It is likewise said, that the Pythagoreans frequently
<span class="pb" id="Page_145">145</span>
inquired and doubted why we accustom
boys to take their food in an orderly and commensurate
manner, and show them that order and symmetry
are beautiful; but that the contraries to
these, disorder and incommensuration, are base;
and that he who is given to wine and is insatiable,
is held in great disgrace. For if no one of these is
useful to us when we have arrived at the age of
virility, it was in vain that we were accustomed,
when boys, to an order of this kind. And there is
also the same reason concerning the other manners
[to which we are accustomed when boys]. This,
therefore, is not seen to happen in other animals
which are disciplined by men; but immediately
from the first, a whelp and a colt are accustomed
to, and learn those things which it is requisite for
them to do when they have arrived at the perfection
of their nature. And universally, it is said
that the Pythagoreans exhorted both those they
happened to meet, and their familiars, to avoid
pleasure as a thing that required the greatest caution.
For nothing so much deceives us, or precipitates
us into error, as this passion. In short, as
it seems, they contended that we should never do
any thing with a view to pleasure as the end. For
this scope is, for the most part, indecorous and
noxious. <i>But they asserted, that especially looking
to the beautiful and decorous, we should do whatever
<span class="pb" id="Page_146">146</span>
is to be done.</i><a class="fn" id="fr_43" href="#fn_43">[43]</a> And that in the second place we
should look to the advantageous and the useful.
These things, however, require no casual judgment.</p>
<p>With respect to what is called desire, these men
are said to have asserted as follows: That <i>desire
indeed, itself, is a certain tendency, impulse, and
appetite of the soul, in order to be filled with something,
or to enjoy something present, or to be disposed
according to some sensitive energy</i>; but that
there is also a desire of the contraries to these, and
this is a desire of the evacuation and absence, and
of having no sensible perception of certain things.
That this passion likewise is various, and is nearly
the most multifarious of all those that pertain to
man. But that many human desires are adscititious,
and procured by men themselves. Hence
<span class="pb" id="Page_147">147</span>
this passion requires the greatest attention, and no
casual care and corporeal exercise. For that the
body when empty should desire food, is natural:
and again, it is also natural, that when filled, it
should desire an appropriate evacuation. But to
desire superfluous nutriment, or superfluous and
luxurious garments or coverlids, or habitations, is
adscititious. They also reasoned in the same manner
concerning furniture, vessels, servants, and
cattle subservient to food. And universally, with
respect to human passions, they are nearly things
of such a kind, as to be nowhere permanent, but
to proceed to infinity. Hence attention should be
paid to youth from the earliest period, in order that
they may aspire after such things as are proper,
may avoid vain and superfluous desires, and thus
be undisturbed by, and purified from, such-like
appetites, and may despise those who are objects of
contempt, because they are bound to [all-various]
desires. But it must be especially observed, that
vain, noxious, superfluous, and insolent desires
subsist with those who have the greatest power.
For there is not any thing so absurd, which the
soul of such boys, men, and women, does not incite
them to perform. In short, the variety of food
which is assumed, is most manifold. For there
are an infinite number of fruits, and an infinite
multitude of roots, which the human race uses for
food. It likewise uses all-various kinds of flesh;
<span class="pb" id="Page_148">148</span>
and it is difficult to find any terrestrial, aerial, or
aquatic animal, which it does not taste. It also
employs all-various contrivances in the preparation
of these, and manifold mixtures of juices. Hence
it properly follows that the human tribe is insane
and multiform, according to the motion of the soul,
for each kind of food that is introduced into the
body, becomes the cause of a certain peculiar disposition.</p>
<p>We however perceive that some things become
immediately the cause of a great change in quality,
as is evident in wine. For when it is drank
abundantly, it makes men at first more cheerful,
but afterwards more insane and indecorous. But
men are ignorant of those things which do not exhibit
a power of this kind; though every thing that
is eaten is the cause of a certain peculiar disposition.
Hence it requires great wisdom, to be able to know
and perceive, what kind and what quantity of food
ought to be used. This science, however, was at
first unfolded by Apollo and P&aelig;on; but afterwards
by Esculapius and his followers.</p>
<p>With respect to generation also, the Pythagoreans
are said to have made the following observations.
In the first place, they thought it necessary
to guard against what is called untimely [offspring].
For neither untimely plants, nor animals, are good;
but prior to their bearing fruit, it is necessary that
a certain time should intervene, in order that seeds
<span class="pb" id="Page_149">149</span>
and fruit may be produced from strong and perfect
bodies. It is requisite, therefore, that boys and
virgins should be accustomed to labors and exercises,
and appropriate endurance, and that food
should be given to them adapted to a life of labor,
temperance, and endurance. But there are many
things of this kind in human life, which it is better
to learn at a late period, and among these is the
use of venery. It is necessary, therefore, that a
boy should be so educated, as not to seek after such
a connexion as this, within the twentieth year of
his age. But when he arrives at this age, he should
use venery rarely. This however will be the case,
if he thinks that a good habit of body is an honorable
and beautiful thing. For intemperance and a
good habit of body, are not very much adapted to
subsist together in the same person. It is also
said, that those laws were praised by the Pythagoreans,
which existed prior to their time in Grecian
cities, and which prohibited the having connexion
with a woman who is a mother, or a daughter,
or a sister, either in a temple, or in a public
place. For it is beautiful and advantageous that
there should be numerous impediments to this
energy. These men also apprehended, as it seems,
that preternatural generations, and those which are
effected in conjunction with wanton insolence,
should be entirely prevented from taking place; but
that those should be suffered to remain, which are
<span class="pb" id="Page_150">150</span>
according to nature, and subsist with temperance,
and which take place in the chaste and legal procreation
of children.</p>
<p>They likewise were of opinion that great providential
attention should be paid by those who beget
children, to the future progeny. The first,
therefore, and the greatest care which should be
taken by him who applies himself to the procreation
of children is, that he lives temperately and
healthfully, that he neither fills himself with food
unseasonably, nor uses such aliments as may render
the habits of the body worse than they were,
and above all things, that he avoids intoxication.
For they thought that depraved seed was produced
from a bad, discordant, and turbid temperament.
And universally they were of opinion, that none
but an indolent and inconsiderate person would
attempt to produce an animal, and lead it into existence,
without providing with all possible diligence
that its ingress into being and life might be most
elegant and pleasing. For those that are lovers of
dogs, pay every possible attention to the generation
of whelps, in order that they may be produced
from such things as are proper, and when it is proper,
and in such a way as is proper, and thus may
become a good offspring. The same attention also
is paid by those who are lovers of birds. And it is
evident that others also who are studious about the
procreation of generous animals, endeavour by all
<span class="pb" id="Page_151">151</span>
possible means, that the generation of them may
not be in vain. It would be absurd therefore that
men should pay no attention to their own offspring,
but should both beget them casually and with perfect
carelessness, and, after they are begotten, nourish
and educate them with extreme negligence. For
this is the most powerful and most manifest cause
of the vice and depravity of the greater part of
mankind. For with the multitude the procreation
of children is undertaken in a beastly and rash
manner. And such were the assertions, and such
the doctrine of these men, which they verified both
in words and deeds, respecting temperance; these
precepts having been originally received by them
from Pythagoras himself, like certain oracles delivered
by the Pythian Apollo.</p>
<h3 id="c32">CHAP. XXXII.</h3>
<p>With respect to fortitude, however, many of the
particulars which have been already related, appropriately
pertain to it; such as the admirable deeds
of Timycha, and of those Pythagoreans who chose
to die rather than transgress the decisions of Pythagoras
concerning beans, and other things conformable
<span class="pb" id="Page_152">152</span>
to such-like pursuits. Such also are the deeds
which Pythagoras himself generously accomplished,
when he travelled everywhere alone, and underwent
immense labors and dangers, choosing to leave
his country, and dwell among strangers. Likewise,
when he dissolved tyrannies, gave an orderly
arrangement to confused polities, and emancipated
cities. When also he caused illegality to cease,
and impeded the operations of insolent and tyrannical
men; exhibiting himself a benignant leader
to the just and mild, but expelling savage and
licentious men from his association, and refusing
even to give them an answer; gladly, indeed, giving
assistance to the former, but with all his might resisting
the latter. Many instances therefore of
these things might be adduced, and of upright actions
frequently performed by him. But the
greatest of all these, is what he said and did to
Phalaris, with an invincible freedom of speech.
For when he was detained in captivity by Phalaris,
the most cruel of tyrants, a wise man of the Hyperborean
race, whose name was Abaris, was his
associate, who came to him for the sake of conversing
with him, and asked him many questions,
and especially such as were of a sacred nature, respecting
statues and the most holy worship, the
providence of the Gods, celestial and terrestrial
natures, and many other things of a similar kind.
But Pythagoras, being under the influence of divine
<span class="pb" id="Page_153">153</span>
inspiration, answered Abaris vehemently, and with
all truth and persuasion, so as to convince those
that heard him. Then, however, Phalaris was inflamed
with anger against Abaris, because he
praised Pythagoras, and was ferociously disposed
towards Pythagoras himself. He also dared to
utter blasphemies against the Gods themselves, and
such as he was accustomed to pour forth. But
Abaris gave Pythagoras thanks for what he said;
and after this, learnt from him that <i>all things
are suspended from and governed by the heavens;
which he evinced to be the case from many other
things, and also from the energy of sacred rites</i>.
And Abaris was so far from thinking that Pythagoras,
who taught these things, was an enchanter,
that he beyond measure admired him as if he had
been a God. To these things, however, Phalaris
replied by endeavouring to subvert divination, and
openly denying the efficacy of the things which are
performed in sacred rites. But Abaris transferred
the discourse from these particulars to such as are
clearly apparent to all men; and endeavoured to
persuade him that there is a divine providence, from
those circumstances which transcend all human
hope and power, whether they are immense wars,
or incurable diseases, or the corruption of fruits,
or the incursions of pestilence, or certain other
things of the like kind, which are most difficult to
be borne, and deplorable, arising from the beneficent
<span class="pb" id="Page_154">154</span>
energies of certain d&aelig;moniacal and divine
powers.<a class="fn" id="fr_44" href="#fn_44">[44]</a></p>
<p>Phalaris, however, shamelessly and audaciously
opposed what was said. Again therefore Pythagoras,
suspecting that Phalaris intended to put him
to death, but at the same time knowing that he was
not destined to die by Phalaris, began to address
him with great freedom of speech. For looking to
Abaris he said, that a transition was naturally
adapted to take place from the heavens to aerial
and terrestrial beings. And again, he showed that
all things follow the heavens, from instances most
known to all men. He likewise indubitably demonstrated,
that the [deliberative] power of the soul
possesses freedom of will. And proceeding still
farther, he amply discussed the perfect energy of
reason and intellect. Afterwards also, with his
[usual] freedom of speech, he spoke concerning
tyranny, and all the prerogatives of fortune, and
concerning injustice and human avarice, and solidly
taught him that all these are of no worth. In the
next place, he gave him a divine admonition concerning
the most excellent life, and earnestly entered
on a comparison of it with the most depraved
<span class="pb" id="Page_155">155</span>
life. He likewise most clearly unfolded to him,
how the soul, and its powers and passions, subsist;
<i>and, what is the most beautiful thing of all, demonstrated
to him that the Gods are not the causes of
evils, and that diseases, and such things as are the
calamities of the body, are the seals of intemperance</i>;
reprehending at the same time mythologists
and poets for what they have badly said in fables
[on this subject]. Confuting Phalaris also, he admonished him,
and exhibited to him through works
what the power of heaven is, and the magnitude of
that power; and proved to him by many arguments,
that legal punishment is reasonably established.
He likewise clearly showed him what the
difference is between men and other animals; and
scientifically discussed internal and external speech.
He also perfectly demonstrated the nature of intellect,
and of the knowledge which descends from it;
together with many other ethical dogmas consequent
to these things.</p>
<p>Farther still, he instructed him in what is most
beneficial among the things that are useful in life;
and in the mildest manner adapted admonitions
harmonising with these; adding at the same time
prohibitions of what ought not to be done. And
that which is the greatest of all, he unfolded to him
the distinction between the productions of fate, and
those of intellect, and also the difference between
what is done by destiny, and what is done by fate.
<span class="pb" id="Page_156">156</span>
He likewise wisely discussed many things concerning
d&aelig;mons, and the immortality of the soul. These
things however pertain to another treatise. But
those particulars are more appropriate to our present
purpose which belong to the cultivation of
fortitude. For if, when situated in the midst of
dreadful circumstances, Pythagoras appears to
have philosophised with firmness of decision, if on
all sides he resisted and repelled fortune, and
strenuously endured its attacks, and if he employed
the greatest freedom of speech towards him who
brought his life into danger, it is evident that he
perfectly despised those things which are thought
to be dreadful, and that he considered them as undeserving
of notice. If also, when he expected according
to appearances to be put to death, he entirely
despised this, and was not moved by the expectation
of it, it is evident that he was perfectly
free from the dread of death.<a class="fn" id="fr_45" href="#fn_45">[45]</a></p>
<p>He performed however what is still more generous
than this, by effecting the dissolution of tyranny,
<span class="pb" id="Page_157">157</span>
restraining the tyrant when he was about to
bring the most deplorable calamities on mankind,
and liberating Sicily from the most cruel and imperious
power. But that it was Pythagoras who
accomplished this, is evident from the oracles of
Apollo, in which it is predicted that the domination
of Phalaris would then be dissolved, when
those that were governed by him should become
better men, and be more concordant with each
other; such as they then became, when Pythagoras
was present with them, through the doctrines
and instruction which he imparted to them. A
greater proof however of the truth of this, is derived
from the time in which it happened. For on the
very same day in which Phalaris put Pythagoras
and Abaris in danger of death, he himself was slain
by stratagem. That also which happened to Epimenides
may be an argument of the truth of these
things. For as he, who was the disciple of Pythagoras,
when certain persons intended to destroy
him, invoked the Furies, and the avenging Gods,
and by so doing caused all those that attempted his
life, to destroy each other;&mdash;thus also Pythagoras,
who gave assistance to mankind, after the manner
and with the fortitude of Hercules, for the benefit
of men, punished and occasioned the death of him
who had acted in an insolent and disorderly manner
towards others; and this through the oracles
themselves of Apollo, to the series of which divinity
<span class="pb" id="Page_158">158</span>
both he and Epimenides spontaneously belonged
from their very birth. And thus far, indeed, we
have thought it requisite to mention this admirable
and strenuous deed, the effect of his fortitude.</p>
<p>We shall however adduce another example of it,
viz. the salvation of legitimate opinion; for, preserving
this, he performed that which appeared to
him to be just, and which was dictated by right
reason, not being diverted from his intention either
by pleasure, or labor, or any other passion, or danger.
His disciples also chose to die rather than
transgress his mandates. And when they were exposed
to all-various fortunes, they preserved invariably
the same manners. When also they were
involved in ten thousand calamities, they never deviated
from his precepts. But it was a never-failing
exhortation with them, always to give assistance
to law, but to be hostile to illegality, and to
be accustomed from their birth to a life of temperance
and fortitude, in order to restrain and repel
luxury. They had also certain melodies which
were devised by them, as remedies against the passions
of the soul, and likewise against despondency
and lamentation, which Pythagoras invented, as
affording the greatest assistance in these maladies.
And again, they employed other melodies against
rage and anger, through which they gave intension
and remission to these passions, till they reduced
them to moderation, and rendered them commensurate
<span class="pb" id="Page_159">159</span>
with fortitude. <i>That, however, which afforded
them the greatest support in generous endurance,
was the persuasion that no human casualties ought
to be unexpected by men who are in the possession of
intellect, but that all things ought to be expected by
them, over which they have no absolute power.</i></p>
<p>Moreover, if at any time they happened to be angry,
or sorrowful, they immediately separated themselves
from the rest of their associates, and each by
himself alone strenuously endeavoured to digest and
heal the passion [by which he was oppressed].
They also conceived generally, that labor should be
employed about disciplines and studies, and that
they should be severely exercised in trials of the
most various nature, in punishments and restraints
by fire and sword, in order to be liberated from innate
intemperance, and an inexhaustible avidity of
possessing; and that for this purpose, no labors,
nor any endurance should be spared. In order to
accomplish this likewise, they generously exercised
abstinence from all animals, and besides this, from
certain other kinds of food. Hence also arose their
detention of speech, and their perfect silence as
preparatory to the subjugation of the tongue; in
which for many years they exercised their fortitude.
To which also may be added, their strenuous and
assiduous investigation and resumption of the most
difficult theorems; and on account of these things,
their abstinence from wine, their paucity of food
<span class="pb" id="Page_160">160</span>
and sleep, and their contempt of glory, wealth, and
the like. And in conjunction with all these particulars,
they extended themselves to fortitude.</p>
<p>It is likewise said, that these men expelled lamentations
and tears, and every thing else of this
kind. They also abstained from entreaty, from
supplication, and from all such illiberal adulation,
as being effeminate and abject.<a class="fn" id="fr_46" href="#fn_46">[46]</a> To the same conception
likewise the peculiarity of their manners
must be referred, and that all of them perpetually
preserved among their arcana, the most principal
dogmas in which their discipline was chiefly contained,
keeping them with the greatest silence from
being divulged to strangers, committing them unwritten
to the memory, and transmitting them
orally to their successors, as if they were the mysteries
of the Gods. Hence it happened, that nothing
of their philosophy worth mentioning, was
made public, and that though for a long time it had
been taught and learnt, it was alone known within
their walls. But to those out of their walls, and as
I may say, to the profane, if they happened to be
present, these men spoke obscurely to each other
<span class="pb" id="Page_161">161</span>
through symbols, of which the celebrated precepts
that are now in circulation retain a vestige; such
as, <a id="er24" href="#en24">Dig not fire with a sword</a>, and other symbols of
the like kind, which, taken literally, resemble the
tales of old women; but when unfolded, impart a
certain admirable and venerable benefit to those
that receive them.</p>
<p>The precept, however, which is of the greatest
efficacy of all others to the attainment of fortitude,
is that which has for its most principal scope the
being defended and liberated from those bonds
which detain the intellect in captivity from infancy,
and without which no one can learn or perceive
any thing sane or true, through whatever sense he
may energize. For according to the Pythagoreans,</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&rsquo;Tis mind that all things sees and hears;</p>
<p class="t0">What else exists is deaf and blind.</p>
</div>
<p>But the precept which is next to this in efficacy is
that which exhorts to be beyond measure studious
of purifying the intellect, and by various methods
adapting it through mathematical orgies to receive
something divinely beneficial, so as neither to fear
a separation from body, nor, when led to incorporeal
natures, to be forced to turn away the eyes,
through their most refulgent splendor,<a class="fn" id="fr_47" href="#fn_47">[47]</a> nor to be
<span class="pb" id="Page_162">162</span>
converted to those passions which nail and fasten the
soul to the body. And, in short, which urges the
soul to be untamed by all those passions which are
the progeny of the realms of generation, and which
draw it to an inferior condition of being. For the
exercise and ascent through all these, is the study
of the most perfect fortitude. And such are the
instances adduced by us of the fortitude of Pythagoras,
and the Pythagoreans.</p>
<h3 id="c33">CHAP. XXXIII.</h3>
<p>With respect to the amity, however, which subsists
in all things towards all, Pythagoras delivered
it in the clearest manner. And, the amity of the
Gods indeed towards men, he unfolded through
piety and scientific cultivation; but that of dogmas
towards each other, and universally of the soul towards
the body, and of the rational towards the
species of the irrational part, through philosophy,
and the theory pertaining to it. With respect to
the amity of men also towards each other; that of
citizens he delivered through sane legislation, but
that of strangers through a correct physiology; and
that between man and wife, or children, or brothers,
<span class="pb" id="Page_163">163</span>
and kindred, through unperverted communion.
In short, he unfolded the friendship of all
things towards all, and still farther, of certain irrational
animals, through justice and a physical connexion
and association. But the pacification and
conciliation of the body, which is of itself mortal,
and of its latent contrary powers, he unfolded
through health, and a diet and temperance conformable
to this, in imitation of the salubrious condition
of the mundane elements. In all these, however,
Pythagoras is acknowledged to have been
the inventor and legislator of the summary comprehension
of them in one and the same name,
which is that of friendship. And indeed he delivered
such an admirable friendship to his associates,
that even now those who are benevolent in the extreme
towards each other, are said to belong to the
Pythagoreans. It is necessary therefore to narrate
the discipline of Pythagoras respecting these things,
and the precepts which he used towards his disciples.</p>
<p>These men, then, exhorted others to remove from
true friendship, contest and contention, and if possible,
indeed, from all friendship; but if not, at
least from that which is parental, and universally
from that which pertains to seniors and benefactors.
For to strive or contend with such as these,
in consequence of anger intervening, or some other
such-like passion, is not the salvation of the existing
<span class="pb" id="Page_164">164</span>
friendship. But they said it is requisite that
there should be the least possible scars and ulcers
in friendships; and that this will be the case, if
those that are friends know how to soften and subdue
anger. If both indeed know this, or rather
the younger of the two, and who ranks in some one
of the above-mentioned orders [their friendship will
be more easily preserved]. They also were of opinion,
that corrections and admonitions, which they
called <i>p&aelig;dartases</i>, should take place from the elder
to the younger with much suavity and caution;
and likewise, that much sedulous and appropriate
attention should be manifested in admonitions.
For thus they will be decorous and beneficial.
They also said, that confidence should never be separated
from friendship, neither seriously nor even
in jest. For it is no longer easy for the existing
friendship to be in a sane condition, when falsehood
once insinuates itself into the manners of
those that acknowledge themselves to be friends.
Again, according to them, friendship should not be
abandoned on account of misfortune, or any other
imbecility to which human life is incident; but
they said, that the only approvable rejection of a
friend and friendship, is that which arises from
great and incorrigible vice. Likewise, that hatred
should not be voluntarily entertained against those
who are not perfectly bad; but that if it is once
formed, it should be generously and strenuously
<span class="pb" id="Page_165">165</span>
retained, unless the object of it changes his manners,
so as to become a better man. That the hostility
also should not consist in words, but in deeds;
And that this war is legitimate and holy, when it is
conducted in such a way as it becomes one man to
contend with another.</p>
<p>They likewise said, that we should never, to the
utmost of our power, become the cause of dissension;
but that we should as much as possible avoid
the source of it. That in the friendship also, which
is intended to be pure, the greater part of the
things pertaining to it ought to be definite and legitimate.
And that these should be properly distinguished,
and should not be casual; and moreover,
that we should be careful that our conversation
may never be negligently and casually performed,
but with modesty, benevolence, and good
order. Also, that no passion, such as desire, or
anger, be rashly excited, and in a bad and erroneous
manner. And the same thing must be said of
the remaining passions and dispositions.</p>
<p>Moreover, that they did not decline foreign
friendships carelessly, but that they avoided and
guarded against them, with the greatest sedulity;
and also, that they rigidly preserved friendship towards
each other for many ages, may be inferred
from what Aristoxenus in his treatise On the Pythagoric
life, says he heard from Dionysius, the
tyrant of Sicily, when having fallen from monarchy
<span class="pb" id="Page_166">166</span>
he taught grammar at Corinth. For Aristoxenus
says as follows: &ldquo;These men as much as possible
prohibited lamentations and tears, and every thing
of this kind; and in a similar manner adulation,
entreaty, supplication, and the like. Dionysius,
therefore, having fallen from his tyranny and come
to Corinth, narrated to us the particulars concerning
Phintias and Damon the Pythagoreans; and
these were respecting the one being sponsor for the
death of the other. But the mode of the suretyship
was as follows: He said that certain persons, who
were familiar with him, had frequently made mention
of the Pythagoreans, defaming and reviling
them, calling them arrogant, and asserting that their
gravity, their pretended fidelity, and apathy would
be laid aside, if any one should cause them to fall
into [some great] calamity. Certain persons however
contradicting this, and contention arising on
the subject, recourse was had to artifice, and one
of the accusers of Phintias said before him, that he
evidently conspired with certain others against the
life of Dionysius. This also was testified by some
that were present, and the charges against Phintias
appeared to be very probable. Phintias therefore
was astonished at the accusation. But when Dionysius
had unequivocally said, that he had accurately
explored all these particulars, and that it was
necessary that he should die, Phintias replied, that
if it appeared requisite to him that this should take
<span class="pb" id="Page_167">167</span>
place, he requested that he would grant him the
remainder of the day, in order that he might settle
his own affairs, and also those of Damon. For
those men lived together, and had all things in
common. Phintias, however, being the elder, the
management of the domestic concerns was for
the most part undertaken by him. He requested
therefore, that Dionysius would suffer him to
depart for this purpose, and he would appoint
Damon for his surety. Dionysius therefore
said that he wondered at the request, and that he
asked him whether there was any man who was
willing to become security for the death of another.
But Phintias asserting that there was, Damon was
sent for, who, on hearing what had happened,
said that he would become the sponsor, and that
he would remain there till Phintias returned.
Dionysius therefore said, that he was immediately
astonished at these circumstances; but that they
who at first introduced the experiment, derided
Damon as one who would be caught, and said
sneeringly that he would be the vicarious stag.
When therefore it was near sunset, Phintias came
to die; at which all that were present were astonished
and subdued. But Dionysius said, that
having embraced and kissed the men, he requested
that they would receive him as the third into their
friendship. They however would by no means
consent to a thing of this kind, though he entreated
<span class="pb" id="Page_168">168</span>
them to comply with his request.&rdquo; And these
things are related by Aristoxenus, who received
them from Dionysius himself.</p>
<p>It is also said, that the Pythagoreans endeavoured
to perform the offices of friendship to those of their
sect, though they were unknown to, and had never
been seen by each other, when they had received
a certain indication of the participation of the same
doctrines; so that from such friendly offices the
assertion may be credited, that worthy men, even
though they should dwell in the most remote parts
of the earth, are mutually friends, and this before
they become known to and salute each other. It
is said therefore, that a certain Pythagorean, travelling
through a long and solitary road on foot,
came to an inn; and there, from labor and other
all-various causes, fell into a long and severe disease,
so as to be at length in want of the necessaries
of life. The inn-keeper, however, whether
from commiseration of the man, or from benevolence,
supplied him with every thing that was requisite,
neither sparing for this purpose any assistance
or expense. But the Pythagorean falling a
victim to the disease, wrote a certain symbol, before
he died, in a table, and desired the inn-keeper,
if he should happen to die, to suspend the table
near the road, and observe whether any passenger
read the symbol. For that person, said he, will
repay you what you have spent on me, and will
<span class="pb" id="Page_169">169</span>
also thank you for your kindness. The inn-keeper,
therefore, after the death of the Pythagorean, having
buried, and paid the requisite attention to his
body, had neither any hopes of being repaid, nor
of receiving any recompense from some one who
might read the table. At the same time, however,
being surprised at the request of the Pythagorean,
he was induced to expose the writing in the public
road. A long time after, therefore, a certain Pythagorean
passing that way, having understood the
symbol, and learnt who it was that placed the table
there, and having also investigated every particular,
paid the inn-keeper a much greater sum of money
than he had disbursed.</p>
<p>It is likewise related of Clinias the Tarentine,
that when he had learnt that Prorus the Cyren&aelig;an,
who was zealously addicted to the Pythagorean
doctrines, was in danger of losing all his property,
he sailed to Cyrene, after having collected a sum of
money, and restored the affairs of Prorus to a better
condition, not only incurring, in so doing, a diminution
of his own property, but despising the
peril which he was exposed to in the voyage. After
the same manner also, Thestor Posidoniates, having
learnt from report alone, that Thymaridas
Parius the Pythagorean had fallen into poverty,
from the possession of great wealth, is said to have
sailed to Parus, after having collected a large sum
of money, and thus reinstated Thymaridas in property.
<span class="pb" id="Page_170">170</span>
These therefore are beautiful instances of
friendship. <i>The decisions, however, of the Pythagoreans
respecting the communion of divine goods,
the concord of intellect, and things pertaining to a
divine soul, are much more admirable than the
above examples. For they perpetually exhorted
each other, not to divulse the God within them.
Hence all the endeavour of their friendship both
in deeds and words, was directed to a certain divine
mixture, to a union with divinity, and to a communion
with intellect and a divine soul.</i> But it is not
possible to find any thing better than this, either
in what is uttered by words, or performed by deeds.
For I am of opinion, that all the goods of friendship
are comprehended in this. Hence, as we
have collected in this, as in a summit, all the prerogatives
of the Pythagoric friendship, we shall omit
to say any thing further about it.</p>
<h3 id="c34">CHAP. XXXIV.</h3>
<p>Since, however, we have thus generally, and
with arrangement, discussed what pertains to Pythagoras
and the Pythagoreans; let us after this
<span class="pb" id="Page_171">171</span>
narrate such scattered particulars relative to this
subject, as do not fall under the above-mentioned
order. It is said, therefore, that each of the Greeks
who joined himself to this community of the Pythagoreans,
was ordered to use his native language.
For they did not approve of the use of a foreign
tongue. Foreigners also united themselves to the
Pythagoric sect, viz. the Messenians, the Lucani,
Picentini, and the Romans. And Metrodorus the
son of Thyrsus who was the father of Epicharmus,<a class="fn" id="fr_48" href="#fn_48">[48]</a>
and who transferred the greater part of his doctrine
to medicine, says in explaining the writings of his
father to his brother, that Epicharmus, and prior to
him Pythagoras, conceived that the best dialect, as
well as the best harmony of music, is the Doric;
that the Ionic and the &AElig;olic participate of the
chromatic harmony; but that the Attic dialect is
replete with this in a still greater degree. They
were also of opinion, that the Doric dialect, which
consists of vocal letters, is enharmonic.</p>
<p>Fables likewise bear testimony to the antiquity
of this dialect. For in these it is said that Nereus
married Doris the daughter of Ocean; by whom
he had fifty daughters, one of which was the mother
of Achilles. Metrodorus also says, that according to
<span class="pb" id="Page_172">172</span>
some, Hellen was the offspring of Deucalion, who
was the son of Prometheus and Pyrrha the daughter
of Epimetheus; and that from him came Dorus,
and &AElig;olus. He farther observes, that he learnt from
the sacred rites of the Babylonians, that Hellen
was the offspring of Jupiter, and that the sons of
Hellen were Dorus, Xuthus, and &AElig;olus; with
which narrations Herodotus also accords. It is
difficult, however, for those in more recent times
to know accurately, in particulars so ancient, which
of these narrations is to be preferred. But it may
be collected from each of these histories, that the
Doric dialect is acknowledged to be the most
ancient; that the &AElig;olic is next to this, which received
its name from &AElig;olus; and that the Ionic
ranks as the third, which derived its appellation
from Ion the son of Xuthus. The Attic is the
fourth, which was denominated from Creusa, the
daughter of Erectheus, and is posterior to the
former dialects by three generations, as it existed
about the time of the Thracians, and the rape of
Orithyia, as is evident from the testimony of most
histories. Orpheus also, who is the most ancient
of the poets, used the Doric dialect.</p>
<p>Of medicine, however, they especially embraced
the di&aelig;tetic species, and in the exercise of this were
most accurate. And in the first place, indeed, they
endeavoured to learn the indications of symmetry,
of labor, food, and repose. In the next place,
<span class="pb" id="Page_173">173</span>
with respect to the preparation of food, they were
nearly the first who attempted to employ themselves
in it, and to define the mode in which it
should be performed. The Pythagoreans likewise
employed cataplasms, more frequently than their
predecessors; but they in a less degree approved
of medicated ointments. These, however, they
principally used in the cure of ulcerations. But
incisions and burnings they admitted the least of
all things. Some diseases also they cured by incantations.
But they are said to have objected to
those who expose disciplines to sale; who open their
souls like the gates of an inn to every man that
approaches to them; and who, if they do not thus
find buyers, diffuse themselves through cities, and,
in short, hire gymnasia and require a reward from
young men for those things which are without
price. Pythagoras, however, concealed the meaning
of much that was said by him, in order that
those who were genuinely instructed might clearly
be partakers of it; but that others, as Homer says
of Tantalus, might be pained in the midst of what
they heard, in consequence of receiving no delight
from thence.</p>
<p>I think also, it was said by the Pythagoreans,
respecting those who teach for the sake of reward,
that they show themselves to be worse than statuaries,
or those artists who perform their work sitting.
For these, when some one orders them to make a
<span class="pb" id="Page_174">174</span>
statue of Hermes, search for wood adapted to the
reception of the proper form; but those pretend
that they can readily produce the works of virtue
from every nature.<a class="fn" id="fr_49" href="#fn_49">[49]</a> The Pythagoreans likewise
said, that it is more necessary to pay attention to
philosophy, than to parents and agriculture; for it is
owing to the latter, indeed, that we live; but philosophers
and preceptors are the causes of our living
well, and becoming wise, in consequence of having
discovered the right mode of discipline and instruction.
Nor did they think fit either to speak or
write in such a way, that their conceptions might
be obvious to any casual persons; but Pythagoras
is said to have taught this in the first place to those
that came to him, that, being purified from all incontinence,
they should preserve in silence the
doctrines they had heard. It is said, therefore, that
he who first divulged the theory of commensurable
and incommensurable quantities, to those who were
unworthy to receive it, was so hated by the Pythagoreans
that they not only expelled him from their
<span class="pb" id="Page_175">175</span>
common association, and from living with them,
but also constructed a tomb for him, as one who
had migrated from the human and passed into a
another life. Others also say, that the Divine
Power was indignant with those who divulged the
dogmas of Pythagoras: for that he perished in the
sea, as an impious person, who rendered manifest
the composition of the <i>icostagonus</i>; viz. who delivered
the method of inscribing in a sphere the
dodecaedron, which is one of what are called the
five solid figures. But according to others, this
happened to him who unfolded the doctrine of
irrational and incommensurable quantities.<a class="fn" id="fr_50" href="#fn_50">[50]</a> Moreover,
all the Pythagoric discipline was symbolic,
and resembled enigmas and riddles, consisting of
apothegms, in consequence of imitating antiquity
in its character; just as the truly divine and
Pythian oracles appear to be in a certain respect
difficult to be understood and explained, to those
who carelessly receive the answers which they give.
Such therefore, and so many are the indications
respecting Pythagoras and the Pythagoreans, which
may be collected from what is disseminated about
them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">176</div>
<h3 id="c35">CHAP. XXXV.</h3>
<p>There were, however, certain persons who were
hostile to these men, and rose against them. That
stratagems therefore were employed to destroy
them, during the absence of Pythagoras, is universally
acknowledged; but those that have written
on this subject, differ in their account of the journey
which he then undertook. For some say that he
went to Pherecydes the Syrian, but others to Metapontum.
Many causes, however, of the stratagems
are enumerated. And one of them, which is said
to have originated from the men called Cylonians,
was as follows: Cylon the Crotonian held the first
place among the citizens for birth, renown, and
wealth; but otherwise, he was a severe, violent,
and turbulent man, and of tyrannical manners.
He had, however, the greatest desire of being made
a partaker of the Pythagoric life, and having applied
himself to Pythagoras, who was now an elderly
man,<a class="fn" id="fr_51" href="#fn_51">[51]</a> for this purpose, was rejected by him on
account of the above-mentioned causes. In consequence
of this, therefore, he and his friends exercised
<span class="pb" id="Page_177">177</span>
violent hostilities against Pythagoras and his
disciples. So vehement likewise and immoderate<a class="fn" id="fr_52" href="#fn_52">[52]</a>
was the ambition of Cylon, and of those who arranged
themselves on his side, that it extended itself
to the very last of the Pythagoreans. Pythagoras,
therefore, for this cause went to Metapontum, and
there is said to have terminated his life. But those
who were called the Cylonians continued to form
stratagems against the Pythagoreans, and to
exhibit indications of all possible malevolence.
Nevertheless, for a certain time the probity of the
Pythagoreans subdued [this enmity,] and also the
decision of the cities themselves, so that they were
willing that their political concerns should be
managed by the Pythagoreans [alone]. At length,
however, the Cylonians became so hostile to the
men,<a class="fn" id="fr_53" href="#fn_53">[53]</a> that setting fire to the house of Milo in
which the Pythagoreans were seated, and were consulting
about warlike concerns; they burnt all the
men except two, Archippus and Lysis. For these
being in perfect vigour, and most robust, escaped
out of the house. But this taking place, and no
mention being made by the multitude of the calamity
which had happened, the Pythagoreans ceased
to pay any further attention to the affairs of government.
<span class="pb" id="Page_178">178</span>
This however happened through two causes,
through the negligence of the cities (for they were
not at all affected by so great a calamity taking
place) and through the loss of those men who were
most qualified to govern. But of the two Pythagoreans
that were saved, and both of whom were
Tarentines, Archippus indeed returned to Tarentum;
but Lysis hating the negligence [of the
cities] went into Greece, and dwelt in the Achaia
of Peloponnesus. Afterwards, he migrated to
Thebes, being stimulated by a certain ardent desire
[of retreating thither]; and <i>there he had for his
auditor Epaminondas who called Lysis his father</i>.
There also Lysis terminated his life. But the rest
of the Pythagoreans, except Archytas of Tarentum,
departed from Italy, and being collected together
in Rhegium, there dwelt with each other. The
most celebrated of them, however, were Phanto,
Echecrates, Polymnastus, and Diocles, who were
Phlyasians; and Xenophilus Chalcidensis of
Thrace. But in the course of time, when the
administration of public affairs proceeded into a
worse condition, these Pythagoreans nevertheless
preserved their pristine manners and disciplines,
though the sect began to fail, till it generously
perished. These things, therefore, are narrated by
Aristoxenus.</p>
<p>Nicomachus, however, in other respects accords
with Aristoxenus, but as to the journey of Pythagoras,
<span class="pb" id="Page_179">179</span>
he says that this stratagem took place, while
Pythagoras was at Delos. For he went there, in
order to give assistance to his preceptor Pherecydes
the Syrian who was then afflicted with the morbus
pedicularis, and when he died, performed the necessary
funeral rites. Then, therefore, those who had
been rejected by the Pythagoreans, and to whom
monuments had been raised, as if they were dead,
attacked them, and committed all of them to the
flames. Afterwards, they were overwhelmed by
the Italians with stones, and thrown out of the
house unburied. At that time, therefore, it happened
that science failed together with those who
possessed scientific knowledge, because till that
period, it was preserved by them in their breasts as
something arcane and ineffable. But such things
only as were difficult to be understood, and which
were not unfolded, were preserved in the memory
of those who did not belong to the Pythagorean
sect; a few things excepted, which certain Pythagoreans,
who happened at that time to be in
foreign lands, preserved as certain sparks of science
very obscure and of difficult investigation. These
also, being left by themselves, and not moderately
dejected by the calamity, were scattered in different
places, and no longer endured to have any communion
with the rest of mankind. But they lived
alone in solitary places, wherever they happened
to meet with them; and each greatly preferred an
<span class="pb" id="Page_180">180</span>
association with himself to that with any other
person.</p>
<p>Fearing, however, lest the name of philosophy
should be entirely exterminated from mankind, and
that they should on this account incur the indignation
of the Gods, by suffering so great a gift of
theirs to perish, they made an arrangement of certain
commentaries and symbols, and likewise,
collected together the writings of the more ancient
Pythagoreans, and of such things as they remembered.
These, each left at his death to his son, or
daughter, or wife, with a strict injunction not to
give them to any one out of the family. This mandate
therefore, was for a long time observed, and
was transmitted in succession to their posterity,</p>
<p>Since, however, Apollonius dissents in a certain
place respecting these particulars, and adds many
things which we have not mentioned, we shall also
insert his narration of the stratagem employed
against the Pythagoreans. He says, therefore, that
the envy of others attended Pythagoras from his
childhood. For as long as he conversed with all
that came to him, he was pleasing to them; but
when he associated with his disciples alone, the
favourable opinion which the multitude entertained
of him was diminished. And they permitted him
indeed, to pay more attention to strangers than to
themselves; but they were indignant at his preferring
some of their fellow-citizens before others, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_181">181</span>
they apprehended that his disciples assembled together
with intentions hostile to them. In the
next place, as the young men that were indignant
with him were of high rank, and surpassed others
in wealth, and when they arrived at a proper age,
not only held the first honors in their own families,
but also managed the affairs of the city in common,
they formed a large body of men (for they were
more than three hundred in number) and in consequence
of this there was but a small part of the
city, which was not conversant with the same manners
and the same pursuits as they were.</p>
<p>Moreover, as long as the Crotonians continued
in their own country, and Pythagoras dwelt with
them, that form of government remained which had
been established when the city was founded, but
which was not pleasing to the people, and therefore
induced them to seek an occasion of producing
a change. When therefore Sybaris was captured,
and the land taken in the war was not divided by
lot, according to the desire of the multitude, their
silent hatred of the Pythagoreans burst forth, and
the populace separated themselves from them. But
the leaders of this dissension were those that were
most near to the Pythagoreans, both by alliance
and familiarity. The cause however of the discord
was this, that many of the actions of the Pythagoreans
offended these leaders, as well as casual
persons, because these actions had something
<span class="pb" id="Page_182">182</span>
peculiar in them when compared with those of
others. But in the greatest of these actions they
conceived that disgrace befel themselves alone.</p>
<p>Farther still, no one of the Pythagoreans called
Pythagoras by his name, but while he was alive,
when they wished to denote him, they called him
<i>divine</i>; and after his death they denominated him
<i>that man</i>; just as Homer represents Eum&aelig;us
when he makes mention of Ulysses, saying,</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Him, tho&rsquo; he&rsquo;s absent, yet I fear, O guest,</p>
<p class="t0">To name; such is the greatness of my love and care.</p>
</div>
<p>Conformably likewise to the precepts of their
master, the Pythagoreans always rose from bed before
the rising of the sun; and never wore a ring
in which the image of God was engraved. They
also carefully observed to adore the rising sun, and
avoided wearing a ring of the above mentioned
description, lest they should have it about them
at funerals, or in some impure place. In a similar
manner, they were attentive to the mandate of Pythagoras,
not to do any thing without previous
deliberation and disquisition; but to form a plan
in the morning of what ought to be done [in the
course of the day,] and at night to call to mind
the actions of the day, by this means at one and
the same time exploring their conduct, and exercising
their memory. Thus too, they observed the
precept, that if any one of their associates appointed
<span class="pb" id="Page_183">183</span>
to meet them at a certain place, they should
stay there till he came through the day and the
night; in this again, the Pythagoreans being accustomed
to remember what was said, and not to
speak casually. In short Pythagoras ordered them
to be attentive to order and method as long as they
lived, and not to blaspheme at the time of death,
but to die with propitious words, such as are used
by those who are sailing out of port into the
Adriatic sea.<a class="fn" id="fr_54" href="#fn_54">[54]</a></p>
<p>The kindred of the Pythagoreans however, were
indignant that the Pythagoreans gave their right
hand to those of their own sect alone, their parents
excepted; and that they shared their possessions
with each other in common, but excluded their
relations from this fellowship, as if they were
strangers. These, therefore, becoming the sources
of the dissension, the rest readily fell into hostility
against the Pythagoreans. Hippasus, also, Diodorus
and Theages said at the same time, that
every citizen ought to be a partaker of the magistracy
and the assembly, and that the rulers should
give an account of their conduct, to those who
were elected by lot for this purpose from the multitude.
But the Pythagoreans, Alcimachus, Dimachus,
<span class="pb" id="Page_184">184</span>
Meton and Democedes opposed this, and
persevered in prohibiting the dissolution of the
polity derived from their ancestors. Those however,
who patronized the multitude, subdued the
other party. The multitude therefore, being assembled
together, Cylon and Ninon who were
rhetoricians accused the Pythagoreans. And of
these, one belonged to the class of the rich, but the
other was a plebeian. They also divided their
harangues between themselves. But of these harangues,
the longer being delivered by Cylon,
Ninon concluded, pretending that he had explored
the arcana of the Pythagoreans, and that he had
connected and committed to writing such particulars
as were especially calculated to criminate
the Pythagoreans, and giving a book to ascribe, he
ordered him to read it. But the book was inscribed
<i>the Sacred Discourse</i>. And the following is a
specimen of what it contained: Friends are to be
venerated in the same manner as the Gods; but
others are to be treated as brutes. This very sentence
also is ascribed to Pythagoras by his disciples,
and is by them expressed in verse as follows:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">He like the blessed Gods his friends rever&rsquo;d,</p>
<p class="t0">But reckon&rsquo;d others men of no account.</p>
</div>
<p>Homer, too, especially deserves to be praised for
calling a king <i>the shepherd of the people</i>. For being
a friend to that government in which the rulers
<span class="pb" id="Page_185">185</span>
are few, he evinced by this epithet that the rest
of men are cattle. To beans it is requisite to be
hostile, as being the leaders of decision by lot; for
by these men were allotted the administration of
affairs. Again, empire should be the object of
desire: for they proclaim that it is better to be one
day a bull, than to be an ox for ever. That the
legal institutes of others are laudable; but that
they should be exhorted to use those which are
known to themselves. In one word, Ninon showed
that their philosophy was a conspiracy against the
multitude, and therefore exhorted them not to hear
the counsellors, but to consider that they would
never have been admitted into the assembly, if the
council of the Pythagoreans had been approved by
the session of a thousand men; so that it was not
fit to suffer those to speak, who prevented to the
utmost of their power others from being heard.
He observed, therefore, that they should consider the
right hand which was rejected by the Pythagoreans,
as hostile to them, when they gave their suffrages
by an extension of the hands, or calculated the
number of the votes. That they should also consider
it to be a disgraceful circumstance, that they
who conquered thirty myriads of men at the river
Tracis, should be vanquished by a thousandth part
of the same number through sedition in the city
itself. In short Ninon so exasperated his hearers
by his calumnies, that in a few days after, a great
<span class="pb" id="Page_186">186</span>
multitude assembled together intending to attack
the Pythagoreans as they were sacrificing to the
Muses in a house near to the temple of Apollo.
The Pythagoreans, however, foreseeing that this
would take place, fled to an inn; but Democedes,
with those that had arrived at puberty, withdrew
to Platea. And those that had dissolved the
laws made a decree in which they accused Democedes
of compelling the younger part of the community
to the possession of empire, and proclaimed
by a cryer that thirty talents should be given to
any one who destroyed him. An engagement also
taking place, and Theages having vanquished Democedes
in that contest, they distributed to him the
thirty talents which the city had promised. But as
the city, and the whole region were involved in many
evils, the exiles were brought to judgment, and
the power of decision being given to three cities,
viz. to the Tarentines, Metapontines, and the Caulonians,
those that were sent by them to determine
the cause were corrupted by money, as we learn
from the chronicles of the Crotonians. Hence the
Crotonians condemned by their own decision those
that were accused, to exile. In consequence, too, of
this decision, and the authority which it conferred
on them, they expelled all those from the city, who
were dissatisfied with the existing state of affairs, and
at the same time banished all their families, asserting
that it was not fit to be impious, and that children
ought not to be divulsed from their parents. They
<span class="pb" id="Page_187">187</span>
likewise abolished loans, and made the land to be
undivided.<a class="fn" id="fr_55" href="#fn_55">[55]</a></p>
<p>Many years after this, when Dinarchus and his
associates were slain in another battle, and Litagus
also was dead, who had been the greatest leader of
the seditious, a certain pity and repentance induced
the citizens to recall those Pythagoreans that
were left, from exile. For this purpose, they sent
ambassadors from Achaia, and through them became
amicable with the exiles, and consecrated
their oaths at Delphi. But the Pythagoreans who
returned from exile were about sixty in number,
except those who were of a more advanced age,
among which were some who applied themselves
to medicine, and restored health to those that were
sick by a certain diet; of which method of cure
they were themselves the authors. It happened
however, that those Pythagoreans who were saved,
and who were particularly celebrated by the multitude,
at that time in which it was said to the lawless,
<i>This is not the condition of things which was
under Ninon</i>;&mdash;these same Pythagoreans having
left the city in order to procure assistance against
the Thurians who invaded the country, perished in
battle, mutually defending each other. But the
<span class="pb" id="Page_188">188</span>
city was so changed into a contrary opinion [of the
Pythagoreans,] that besides the praise which it bestowed
on them, it apprehended that it would gratify
the Muses in a still greater degree, if it performed
a public sacrifice in the temple of the
Muses, which at the request of the Pythagoreans,
they had before constructed in honor of those Goddesses,
And thus much concerning the attack
which was made on the Pythagoreans.</p>
<h3 id="c36">CHAP. XXXVI.</h3>
<p>The successor, however, of Pythagoras, is acknowledged
by all men to have been Arist&aelig;us, the
son of Damophon the Crotonian, who existing at
the same time as Pythagoras, was seven ages prior
to Plato. Arist&aelig;us likewise, was not only thought
worthy to succeed Pythagoras in his school, but
also to educate his children, and marry his wife
Theano, because he was eminently skilled in the
Pythagoric dogmas. For Pythagoras himself is
said to have taught in his school, forty years wanting
one, and to have lived nearly one hundred
years. But Arist&aelig;us, when much advanced in
<span class="pb" id="Page_189">189</span>
years, relinquished the school; and after him
Mnesarchus succeeded, who was the son of Pythagoras.
Bulagoras succeeded Mnesarchus, in whose
time it happened that the city of the Crotonians was
plundered. Gartydas the Crotonian succeeded
Bulagoras, on his return from a journey which he
had undertaken prior to the war. Nevertheless on
account of the calamity of his country, he suffered
so much anxiety, as to die prematurely through
grief. But it was the custom with the rest of the
Pythagoreans, when they became very old, to liberate
themselves from the body as from a prison.</p>
<p>Moreover, some time after, Aresas Lucanus, being
saved through certain strangers, undertook the
management of the school; and to him came Diodorus
Aspendius, who was received into the school,
on account of the paucity of the Pythagoreans it
contained. And in Heraclea, indeed, were Clinias
and Philolaus; but at Metapontum, Theorides and
Eurytus; and at Tarentum Archytas. It is also
said that Epicharmus was one of the foreign auditors;
but that he was not one of the school. Having
however arrived at Syracuse, he abstained from
philosophizing openly, on account of the tyranny
of Hiero. But he inserted the conceptions of the
men in metre, and published in comedies the occult
dogmas of Pythagoras.</p>
<p>Of all the Pythagoreans, however, it is probable
that many are unknown and anonymous. But the

<br />HIPPODAMUS, THE THURIAN,
<br /><span class="smallest">IN HIS TREATISE</span>
<br />ON FELICITY.</h2>
<p>Of animals, some are the recipients of felicity, but
others are incapable of receiving it. And those
animals, indeed, are receptive of it that have reason.
For felicity cannot subsist without virtue; and virtue
is first ingenerated in that which possesses
reason. But those animals are incapable of receiving
felicity, that are destitute of reason. For
neither can that which is deprived of sight, receive
the work or the virtue of sight; nor can that which
is destitute of reason, be the recipient of the work,
or the virtue of that which possesses reason. With
respect to felicity, however, and virtue, the former
is as a work, but the latter as a certain art, to that
which possesses reason. But of animals which
<span class="pb" id="Page_196">196</span>
possess reason, some are self-perfect, and these are
such as are perfect through themselves, and are indigent
of nothing external, either to their existence,
or to their existing well and beautifully. And such,
indeed, is God. Those animals, however, are not
self-perfect, which are not perfect through themselves,
but are in want of external causes to their
perfection. And man is an animal of this kind.
Of animals, therefore, which are not self-perfect,
some indeed are perfect, but others are not perfect.
And those indeed are perfect which derive their
subsistence both from their own [proper] causes,
and from external causes. And they derive it indeed
from their own causes, because they obtain
from thence both an excellent nature and deliberate
choice; but from external causes, because
they receive from thence equitable legislation and
good rulers. But the animals which are not perfect,
are either such as participate of neither of
these, or of some one of these, or whose souls are
entirely depraved. And such will the man be who
is of a description different from the above.</p>
<p>Moreover, of perfect men there are two differences.
For some of them are naturally perfect;
but others are perfect according to life. And those
indeed alone that are good, are naturally perfect.
But these are such as possess virtue. For the virtue
of the nature of every thing is a summit and
perfection. Thus the virtue of the eye is the summit
<span class="pb" id="Page_197">197</span>
and perfection of the nature of the eye. But
the virtue of man is the summit and perfection of
the nature of man. Those also are perfect according
to life, who are not only good, but happy. For
felicity, indeed, is the perfection of human life. But
human, life is a system of actions: and: felicity gives
completion to the actions. Virtue also and fortune
give completion to actions; virtue, indeed, according
to use; but good fortune according to
prosperity. God therefore is neither good through
learning virtue from any one, nor is he happy
through being attended by good fortune. For he
is good by nature, and happy by nature, and always
was and will be, and will never cease to be, such;
since he is incorruptible, and naturally good. But
man is neither happy nor good by nature, but requires
discipline and providential care. And in
order to become good, indeed; he requires virtue;
but in order to become happy, good fortune. On
this account, human felicity summarily consists of
these two things, viz. of praise, and the predication
of beatitude. Of praise indeed, from virtue; but
of the predication of beatitude, from prosperity.
It possesses virtue therefore, through a divine destiny,
but prosperity through a mortal allotment.
But mortal are suspended from divine concerns,
and terrestrial from such as are celestial. Things
subordinate, also, are suspended from such as are
more excellent. And on this account, the good
<span class="pb" id="Page_198">198</span>
man who follows the Gods is happy; but he who
follows mortal natures is miserable. For to him
who possesses wisdom, prosperity is good and useful.
It is good, indeed, through his knowledge of
the use of it; but it is useful, through his co-operating
with actions. It is beautiful, therefore, when
prosperity is present with intellect, and when sailing
as it were with a prosperous wind, actions are
performed looking to virtue; just as a pilot looks
to the motions of the stars. For thus, he who does
this will not only follow God, but will also co-arrange
human with divine good.</p>
<p>This also is evident, that [human] life becomes
different from disposition and action. But it is necessary
that the disposition should be either worthy
or depraved; and that action should be attended
either with felicity or misery. And a worthy disposition,
indeed, participates of virtue; but a bad
one of vice. With respect to actions, also, those
that are prosperous are attended with felicity; (for
they derive their completion through looking to reason)
but those that are unfortunate, are attended
with misery; for they are frustrated of the end.
Hence, it is not only necessary to learn virtue, but
also to possess and use it, either for security, or increase,
[of property when it is too little] or, which
is the greatest thing of all, for the emendation of
families and cities. For it is not only necessary to
have the possession of things beautiful, but also the
<span class="pb" id="Page_199">199</span>
use of them. All these things, however, will take
place, when a man lives in a city that uses equitable
laws. And these, indeed, I say, are what is
called the horn of Amalthea. For all things are
contained in equitable legislation. And without
this, the greatest good of human nature can neither
be effected, nor, when effected, be increased
and become permanent. For this comprehends in
itself virtue, and the tendency to virtue; because
excellent natures are generated according to it.
Manners, likewise, studies, and laws, subsist through
this in the most excellent condition; and besides
these, rightly-deciding reason, and piety and sanctity
towards the most honorable natures. So that
it is necessary that he who is to be happy, and
whose life is to be prosperous, should live and die
in a country governed by equitable laws, relinquishing
all illegality. At the same time what
has been said is attended with necessity. For
man is a part of society, and hence from the
same reasoning, will become entire and perfect,
if he not only associates with others, but associates
in a becoming manner. For some things are
naturally adapted to subsist in many things, and not
in one thing; others in one thing, and not in many;
but others both in many, and in one thing, and on
this account in one thing, because in many. For
harmony, indeed, and symphony and number, are
naturally adapted to be ingenerated in many things.
<span class="pb" id="Page_200">200</span>
For nothing which makes a whole from these parts,
is sufficient to itself.<a class="fn" id="fr_57" href="#fn_57">[57]</a> But acuteness of seeing and
hearing, and swiftness of feet, subsist in one thing
alone. Felicity, however, and the virtue of soul,
subsist both in one thing and in many, in a whole,
and in the universe. And on this account they
subsist in one thing, because they also subsist in
many: and they subsist in many, because they are
inherent in a whole and in the universe. For the
orderly distribution of the whole nature of things
methodically arranges each particular. And the
orderly distribution of particulars gives completion
to the whole of things and to the universe.
<a id="er25" href="#en25">But this follows from the whole being naturally prior to the part, and not the part to the whole</a>. For if the
world was not, neither the sun nor the moon would
exist, nor the planets, nor the fixed stars. But the
world existing, each of these also exists.</p>
<p>The truth of this also may be seen in the nature
itself of animals. For if animal had no existence,
there would neither be eye, nor mouth, nor ear.
But animal existing, each of these likewise exists.
As the whole, however, is to the part, so is the virtue
of the whole to the virtue of the part. For
harmony not existing, and a divine inspection of
<span class="pb" id="Page_201">201</span>
mundane affairs, things which are adorned would
no longer be able to remain in an excellent condition.
And equitable legislation not existing in a
city, it is not possible for a citizen to be good or
happy. Health, likewise, not existing in the animal,
it is not possible for the foot or the hand to be
strong and healthy. For harmony indeed is the
virtue of the world; equitable legislation is the
virtue of a city; and health and strength are the
virtue of the body. Each of the parts likewise in
these things is co-arranged on account of the whole
and the universe. For the eyes see on account of
the whole body. And the other parts and members
are co-arranged for the sake of the whole
[body] and the universe.</p>

<br />EURYPHAMUS,
<br /><span class="smallest">IN HIS TREATISE</span>
<br />CONCERNING HUMAN LIFE.</h2>
<p>The perfect life of man falls short indeed of the
life of God, because it is not self-perfect, but surpasses
that of irrational animals, because it participates
of virtue and felicity. For neither is God in
want of external causes; since being naturally
good and happy, he is perfect from himself; nor
any irrational animal. For brutes being destitute
of reason, they are also destitute of the sciences
pertaining to actions. But the nature of man
partly consists of his own proper deliberate choice,
and partly is in want of the assistance derived from
divinity. For that which is capable of being
fashioned by reason, which has an intellectual perception
of things beautiful and base, can erectly
extend itself from earth, and look to heaven, and
can perceive with the eye of intellect the highest
<span class="pb" id="Page_203">203</span>
Gods,&mdash;that which is capable of all this, participates
likewise of assistance from the Gods. But
in consequence of possessing will, deliberate choice,
and a principle of such a kind in itself as enables
it to study virtue, and to be agitated by the storms
of vice, to follow, and also to apostatize from the
Gods,&mdash;it is likewise able to be moved by itself.
Hence it is a partaker of praise and blame, honor
and ignominy, partly from the Gods and partly
from men, according as it zealously applies itself
either to virtue or vice. For the whole reason of
the thing is as follows: Divinity introduced man
into the world as a most exquisite animal, to be
reciprocally honored with himself, and <i>as the eye
of the orderly distribution of things</i>. Hence also
man gave names to things, becoming himself the
character of them. He likewise invented letters,
procuring through these a treasury of memory.
And he imitated the established order of the universe,
co-harmonizing by judicial proceedings and
laws the communion of cities. For no work is
performed by men more decorous to the world, or
more worthy of the notice of the Gods, than the
apt constitution of a city governed by good laws,
and an orderly distribution of laws and a polity.
For though each man himself by himself is nothing,
and is not himself by himself sufficient to lead a life
conformable to the common concord, and apt composition
of a polity, yet he is well adapted to the
<span class="pb" id="Page_204">204</span>
whole and to the perfect system of society. For
the life of man is the image of a lyre accurately
[harmonized,] and in every respect perfect. For
every lyre requires these three things, apparatus,
apt composition, and a certain musical contrectation.
And apparatus indeed, is a preparation of
all the appropriate parts; viz. of the chords, and
of the instruments which co-operate with the well-sounding
and striking of the lyre. But the apt composition
is the commixture of the sounds with each
other. And the musical contrectation is the motion
of these conformably to the apt composition. Thus
also human life requires these same three things.
Apparatus, indeed, which is the completion of the
parts of life. But the parts of life are the goods of
the body, of riches, renown, and friends. The apt
composition is the co-arrangement of these according
to virtue and the laws. And the musical contrectation
is the commixture of these conformably
to virtue and the laws; virtue sailing with a prosperous
wind, and having nothing externally resisting
it. For felicity does not consist in being
driven from the purpose of voluntary intentions,
but in obtaining them; nor in virtue being without
attendants and ministrant aids; but in completely
possessing its own proper powers which are adapted
to actions. For man is not self-perfect, but imperfect.
And he becomes perfect, partly from himself,
and partly from an external cause. He is
<span class="pb" id="Page_205">205</span>
likewise perfect, either according to nature, or according
to life. And he is perfect indeed according
to nature, if he becomes a good man. For the
virtue of each thing is the summit and perfection of
the nature of that thing. Thus the virtue<a class="fn" id="fr_58" href="#fn_58">[58]</a> of the
eyes is the summit and perfection of the nature of
the eyes; and this is also true of the virtue of the
ears. Thus too, the virtue of man is the summit
and perfection of the nature of man. But man is
perfect according to life, when he becomes happy.
For felicity is the perfection and completion of human
goods. Hence, again, virtue and prosperity
become the parts of the life of man. And virtue,
indeed, is a part of him so far as he is soul, but
prosperity so far as he is connected with body.
But both are parts of him so far as he is an animal.
For it is the province of virtue to use in a
becoming manner the goods which are conformable
to nature; but of prosperity to impart the use of
them. And the former, indeed, imparts deliberate
choice and right reason; but the latter, energies
and actions. For to wish what is beautiful in conduct
and to endure things of a dreadful nature, is the
proper business of virtue. But it is the work of
prosperity to render deliberate choice successful,
<span class="pb" id="Page_206">206</span>
and to cause actions to arrive at the [desired] end.
For the general conquers in conjunction with virtue
and good fortune. The pilot sails well in conjunction
with art and prosperous winds. The eye
sees well in conjunction with acuteness of vision<a class="fn" id="fr_59" href="#fn_59">[59]</a>
and light. And the life of man becomes most excellent
through virtue itself, and prosperity.</p>

<br />HIPPARCHUS,
<br /><span class="smallest">IN HIS TREATISE</span>
<br />ON TRANQUILLITY.</h2>
<p>Since men live but for a very short period, if their
life is compared with the whole of time, they will
make a most beautiful journey as it were, if they
pass through life with tranquillity. This however
they will possess in the most eminent degree, if
they accurately and scientifically know themselves,
viz. if they know that they are mortal and of a
fleshly nature, and that they have a body which is
corruptible and can be easily injured, and which is
exposed to every thing most grievous and severe,
even to their latest breath. And in the first place,
let us direct our attention to those things which
happen to the body; and these are pleurisy, inflammation
of the lungs, phrensy, gout, stranguary,
dysentery, lethargy, epilepsy, putrid ulcers, and
ten thousand other diseases. But the diseases
<span class="pb" id="Page_208">208</span>
which happen to the soul are much greater and
more dire than these. For all the iniquitous, evil,
illegal, and impious conduct in the life of man,
originates from the passions of the soul. For
through preternatural immoderate desires many
have become subject to unrestrained impulses, and
have not refrained from the most unholy pleasures,
arising from being connected with daughters or
even mothers. Many also have been induced to
destroy their fathers, and their own offspring. But
what occasion is there to be prolix in narrating externally
impending evils, such as excessive rain,
drought, violent heat and cold; so that frequently
from the anomalous state of the air, pestilence and
famine are produced, and all-various calamities,
and whole cities become desolate? Since therefore
many such-like calamities are impendent, we
should neither be elevated by the possession of corporeal
goods, which may rapidly be consumed by
the incursions of a small fever, nor with what are
conceived to be prosperous external circumstances,
which frequently in their own nature perish more
rapidly than they accede. For all these are uncertain
and unstable, and are found to have their
existence in many and various mutations; and no
one of them is permanent, or immutable, or stable,
or indivisible. Hence well considering these things,
and also being persuaded, that if what is present
and is imparted to us, is able to remain for the
<span class="pb" id="Page_209">209</span>
smallest portion of time, it is as much as we ought to
expect; we shall then live in tranquillity and with
hilarity, generously bearing whatever may befal
us.</p>
<p>Now, however, many previously conceiving in
imagination, that all that is present with, and imparted
to them by nature and fortune, is better
than it is, and not thinking it to be such as it is in
reality, but such as it is able to become when it
has arrived at the summit of excellence, they burden
the soul with many great, nefarious, and stupid
evils, when they are suddenly deprived of [these
evanescent goods]. And thus it happens to them
that they lead a most bitter and miserable life.
But this takes place in the loss of riches, or the
death of friends or children, or in the privation of
certain other things, which are conceived by them
to be most honorable possessions. Afterwards,
weeping and lamenting, they assert of themselves,
that they alone are most unfortunate and miserable,
not remembering that these things have happened,
and even now happen, to many others; nor are
they able to understand the life of those that are
now in existence, and of those that have lived in
former times, nor to see in what great calamities
and waves of evils, many of the present time are,
and of the past have been involved. Considering
with ourselves therefore, that many having lost
their property, have afterwards on account of this
<span class="pb" id="Page_210">210</span>
very loss been saved, since hereafter they might
either have fallen into the hands of robbers, or into
the power of a tyrant; that many also who have
loved certain persons, and have been benevolently
disposed towards them in the extreme, have afterwards
greatly hated them;&mdash;considering all these
things, which have been delivered to us by history,
and likewise learning that many have been destroyed
by their children, and by those that they have
most dearly loved; and comparing our own life
with that of those who have been more unhappy
than we have been, and taking into account human
casualties [in general] and not only such as happen
to ourselves, we shall pass through life with
greater tranquillity. For it is not lawful that he
who is himself a man, should think the calamities
of others easy to be borne, and not his own, since
he sees that the whole of life is naturally exposed
to many calamities. Those however, that weep
and lament, besides not being able to recover
what they have lost, or recal to life those that are
dead, impel the soul to greater perturbations, in
consequence of its being filled with much depravity.
It is requisite therefore, that, being washed
and purified, we should by all possible contrivances
wipe away our inveterate stains by the
reasonings of philosophy. But we shall accomplish
this by adhering to prudence and temperance,
being satisfied with our present circumstances, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_211">211</span>
not aspiring after many things. For men who
procure for themselves a great abundance [of external
goods], do not consider that the enjoyment of
them terminates with the present life. We ought
therefore to use the goods that are present; and
by the assistance of the beautiful and venerable
things of which philosophy is the source, we shall
be liberated from the insatiable desire of depraved
possessions.</p>

<h2 id="c41"><span class="small"><span class="smallest">FROM</span></span>
<br />ARCHYTAS,
<br /><span class="smallest">IN HIS TREATISE CONCERNING</span>
<br />THE GOOD AND HAPPY MAN.</h2>
<p>In the first place, it is requisite to know this, that
the good man is not immediately happy from necessity;
but that this is the case with the man who
is both happy and good. For the happy man obtains
both praise and the predication of blessedness;
but the good man <span class="struck">far as he is good</span> obtains
praise alone. The praise also arises from
virtue; but the predication of blessedness from
good fortune. And the worthy man, indeed, becomes
such from the goods which he possesses;
but the happy man is sometimes deprived of his
felicity. For the power of virtue is perfectly free,
but that of felicity is subject to restraint. For
long-continued diseases of the body, and deprivations
of the senses, cause the florishing condition
of felicity to waste away. God, however, differs from
<span class="pb" id="Page_213">213</span>
a good man in this, that God indeed not only possesses
virtue genuine and purified from every mortal
passion, but his power also is unwearied and
unrestrained, as being adapted to the most venerable
and magnificent production of eternal works.
Man indeed, by the mortal condition of his nature,
not only enjoys this power and this virtue in a less
degree; but sometimes through the want of symmetry<a class="fn" id="fr_60" href="#fn_60">[60]</a>
in the goods which he possesses, or through
powerful custom, or a depraved nature, or through
many other causes, he is unable to possess in the
extreme a good which is perfectly true.</p>
<p>Since therefore of goods, some are eligible for
their own sakes, and not for the sake of another
thing; but others are eligible for the sake of something
else, and not on their own account; there is
also a certain third species of goods, which is eligible
both on its own account, and for the sake of
another thing. What, therefore, is the good which
is eligible on its own account, and not for the sake
of something else? It is evident that it is felicity.
For we aspire after other things for the sake of this,
but we do not desire this for the sake of any thing
else. Again, what are those goods which we desire
indeed for the sake of something else, but which we
do not desire on their own account? It is evident
they are such things as are useful, and pre-eligible
<span class="pb" id="Page_214">214</span>
goods, which become the causes of our obtaining
things which are eligible [on their own account];
such as corporeal labors, exercise, and frictions
which are employed for the sake of a good habit of
body; and also reading, meditation, and study,
which are undertaken for the sake of things beautiful
and virtue. But what are the things which
are eligible on their own account, and also for the
sake of something else? They are such things as
the virtues, and the habits of them, deliberate
choice and actions, and whatever adheres to that
which is really beautiful. Hence, that indeed
which is eligible on its own account, and not on account
of something else, is a solitary good and one.
But that which is eligible for its own sake, and for
the sake of another thing, is triply divided. For
one part of it indeed subsists about the soul; another
about the body; and another pertains to externals.
And that which is about the soul, consists
of the virtues of the soul; that which is about
the body, of the virtues of the body; and that
which pertains to externals, consists of friends,
glory, honor, and wealth. There is likewise a similar
reasoning with respect to that which is eligible
on account of something else. For one part of it
indeed is effective of the goods of the soul; another
part of it, of the goods of the body; and that
which pertains to externals is the cause of wealth,
glory, honor, and friendship.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">215</div>
<p>That virtue however happens to be eligible for
its own sake, is evident from the following considerations.
For if things which are naturally subordinate,
I mean the goods of the body, are eligible
for their own sakes, but the soul is better than
the body, it is evident that we love the goods of the
soul on their own account, and not for the sake of
the consequences with which they are attended.</p>
<p>There are likewise three definite times of human
life; one of prosperity; another of adversity; and
a third subsisting between these. Since therefore,
he is a good man who possesses and uses virtue;
but he uses it according to three seasons; for he
uses it either in adversity, or in prosperity, or in
the time between these; and in adversity indeed
he is unhappy, but in prosperity happy, and in the
middle condition, he is not happy [though he is not
miserable];&mdash;this being the case, it is evident that
felicity is nothing else than the use of virtue in
prosperity. We now speak, however, of the felicity
of man. But man is not soul alone, but is
likewise body. For the animal which consists of
both, and that which is constituted from things of
this kind is man. For though the body is naturally
adapted to be the instrument of the soul, yet
this as well as the soul is a part of man [so far as
he is an animal.<a class="fn" id="fr_61" href="#fn_61">[61]</a>] Hence of goods also, some are
<span class="pb" id="Page_216">216</span>
the goods of man, but others, of the parts of man.
And the good of man, indeed, is felicity. But of
the parts of man, the good of the soul is prudence,
fortitude, justice, and temperance. And the good
of the body is beauty, health, a good corporeal habit,
and excellence of sensation. With respect to externals
however, wealth, glory, honor, and nobility,
are naturally adapted to be attendant on man, and
to follow precedaneous goods. The less, also, are
ministrant to the greater goods. Thus friendship,
glory, and wealth, are ministrant both to the body
and the soul; but health, strength, and excellence
of sensation, are subservient to the soul; and prudence
[i.&nbsp;e. wisdom] and justice are ministrant to
the intellect of the soul. <i>Intellect, however, is the
satellite of Deity.</i> For God is the most excellent,
and the leader and ruler of all things. And for the
sake of these, it is necessary that other goods should
be present. For the general, indeed, is the leader
of the army; the pilot, of the ship; God, of the
world; and intellect, of soul. But prudence is the
leader of the felicity pertaining to life. For prudence
is nothing else than the science of the felicity
which respects human life, or the science of the
goods which naturally pertain to man.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">217</div>
<p>And the felicity, indeed, and life of God are
most excellent; but the felicity of man consists of
science, and virtue, and in the third place of prosperity<a class="fn" id="fr_62" href="#fn_62">[62]</a>
corporalized. But I mean by science, the
wisdom pertaining to things divine and demoniacal;
and by prudence, the wisdom pertaining to
human concerns, and the affairs of life. For it
is requisite to call the virtues which employ reasonings
and demonstrations, sciences. But it is fit
to denominate virtue ethical, and the best habit of
the irrational part of the soul, according to which
we are said to possess certain qualities pertaining
to manners; viz. by which we are called liberal,
<span class="pb" id="Page_218">218</span>
just, and temperate. But it is requisite to call
prosperity, the preter-rational presence of goods,
[or a supply of goods without the assistance of reason,]
and which is not effected on account of it.
Since therefore virtue and science are in our
power, but prosperity is not; and since also felicity
consists in the contemplation and performance
of things [truly] beautiful; but contemplations and
actions, when they are not prosperous, are attended
with ministrant offices and necessity, but when they
proceed in the right path, produce delight and felicity;
and these things are effected in prosperity;&mdash;this
being the case, it is evident that <i>felicity is
nothing else than the use of virtue in prosperity</i>.
Hence the good man is disposed with respect to
prosperity, in the same manner as he who has an
excellent and robust body. For such a one is able
to endure heat and cold, to raise a great burden,
and to sustain easily many other molestations.</p>
<p>Since therefore felicity is the use of virtue in
prosperity, we must speak concerning virtue and
prosperity, and in the first place concerning prosperity.
For of goods, some indeed do not admit
of excess, and this is the case with virtue. For
there is not any virtue which is excessive, nor any
worthy man who is beyond measure good. For
virtue has the fit and becoming for a rule, and is
the habit of the decorous in practical concerns.
But prosperity receives excess and diminution.
<span class="pb" id="Page_219">219</span>
And when it is excessive indeed, it generates certain
vices, and removes a man from his natural
habit; so that he frequently through this opposes
the constitution of virtue. And this is not only
the case with prosperity, but many other causes
likewise may effect the same thing. For it is by
no means proper to wonder, that some of those
who play on the pipe should be arrogant men, who,
bidding farewell to truth, ensnare by a certain false
imagination those who are unskilled in music; and
to disbelieve that a thing of this kind does not take
place in virtue. For the more venerable a thing is,
so much the more numerous are those that pretend
to the possession of it. For there are many things
which distort the habit and form of virtue; some of
which are insidious arts and affectation; others are
kindred physical passions, which sometimes produce
an indecorum<a class="fn" id="fr_63" href="#fn_63">[63]</a> contrary to the true disposition
[of virtue.] This also is effected through manners
in which men have been nurtured for a long time;
and it not unfrequently happens that it is produced
through youth or old age, and through prosperity
or adversity; and by other very numerous ways.
Hence, we ought never to wonder, if sometimes a
distorted judgment is formed of all things, the true
disposition being changed.<a class="fn" id="fr_64" href="#fn_64">[64]</a> Thus we see that the
<span class="pb" id="Page_220">220</span>
most excellent carpenter frequently errs in the
works which are the subjects of his art; and this is
also the case with the general, the pilot, the
painter, and in short, with all artists. And yet at
the same time we do not deprive them of the habit
which they possess. For as we do not rank among
bad men him who at certain times acts intemperately,
or unjustly, or timidly; so neither do we
place him in the class of good men, who does
something right in things pertaining to temperance,
or justice, or fortitude. But it must be said that
the conduct of bad men in things of this kind is
casually right, and that good men [sometimes] err.
A true judgment however [in these instances] is to
be formed, not by looking to a certain occasion, or
to a certain extent of time, but to the whole of life.
But as indigence and excess are injurious to the
body, yet excess and what are called superfluities,
are naturally adapted to produce greater diseases
[than those caused by indigence]; thus also prosperity
or adversity injure the soul, when they unseasonably
happen; yet that which is called by all
men prosperity, is naturally adapted to produce
greater diseases [than adversity], since it intoxicates
<span class="pb" id="Page_221">221</span>
like wine the reasoning power of good
men.</p>
<p>Hence it is more difficult to bear prosperity in a
becoming manner than adversity. For all men
when they continue in adversity, are seen for the
most part to be moderate and orderly in their manners;
but in prosperity they are brave, magnificent,
and magnanimous [when they bear it in a becoming
manner]. For adversity has the power of contracting
and depressing the soul; but prosperity, on the
contrary, elevates and expands it. Hence all those
that are unfortunate, are in their manners cautious
and prudent; but those that are fortunate are insolent
and confident. But the boundary of prosperity,
is that which a good man would deliberately
choose to co-operate with him in his own proper actions;
just as the [proper] magnitude of a ship, and
the [proper] magnitude of a rudder, are such as will
enable a good pilot to sail over a great extent of
sea, and to accomplish a great voyage. An excess
of prosperity, however, is not naturally adapted to
be vanquished by, but to vanquish the soul. For
as a [very] splendid light causes an obscuration of
sight in the eyes; thus also excessive prosperity
darkens the intellect of the soul. And thus much
may suffice concerning prosperity.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">222</div>
<h2 id="c42"><span class="small"><span class="smallest">FROM</span></span>
<br />THEAGES,
<br /><span class="smallest">IN HIS TREATISE</span>
<br />ON THE VIRTUES.</h2>
<p>The order of the soul subsists in such a way, that
one part of it is the reasoning power, another is
anger, and another is desire. And the reasoning
power, indeed, has dominion over knowledge; anger
over impetus; and desire intrepidly rules over
the appetitions of the soul. When therefore these
three parts pass into one, and exhibit one appropriate
composition, then virtue and concord are
produced in the soul. But when they are divulsed
from each other by sedition, then vice and discord
are produced in the soul. It is necessary, however,
that virtue should have these three things, viz. reason,
power, and deliberate choice. The virtue,
therefore, of the reasoning power of the soul is
prudence; for it is a habit of judging and contemplating.
But the virtue of the irascible part, is fortitude;
<span class="pb" id="Page_223">223</span>
for it is a habit of resisting, and enduring
things of a dreadful nature. And the virtue of the
epithymetic or appetitive part is temperance; for it
is a moderation and detention of the pleasures
which arise through the body. But the virtue of
the whole soul is justice. For men indeed become
bad, either through vice, or through incontinence,
or through a natural ferocity. But they injure
each other, either through gain, or through pleasure,
or through ambition. Vice, therefore, more
appropriately belongs to the reasoning part of the
soul. For prudence indeed is similar to art; but
vice to pernicious art. For it invents contrivances
for the purpose of acting unjustly. But incontinence
rather pertains to the appetitive part of the
soul. For continence consists in subduing, and incontinence
in not subduing pleasures. And ferocity
pertains to the irascible part of the soul. For
when some one, through acting ill from desire, is
gratified not as a man should be, but as a wild
beast, then a thing of this kind is denominated ferocity.
The effects also of these dispositions are
consequent to the things for the sake of which they
are performed. For avarice is consequent to vice;
but vice is consequent to the reasoning part of the
soul. And ambition, indeed, follows from the irascible
part; and this becoming excessive, generates
ferocity. Again, pleasure pertains to the appetitive
<span class="pb" id="Page_224">224</span>
part; but this being sought after more vehemently,
generates incontinence. Hence, since the
acting unjustly is produced from so many causes,
it is evident that acting justly is effected through an
equal number of causes. For virtue, indeed, is
naturally beneficent and profitable; but vice is productive
of evil, and is noxious.</p>
<p>Since, however, of the parts of the soul, one is
the leader, but the other follows, and the virtues
and the vices subsist about these, and in these; it
is evident that with respect to the virtues also, some
are leaders, others are followers, and others, are
composed from these. And the leaders, indeed,
are such as prudence; but the followers are such
as fortitude and temperance; and the composites
from these, are such as justice. The passions, however,
are the matter of virtue; for the virtues subsist
about, and in these. But of the passions, one
is voluntary, but another is involuntary. And the
voluntary, indeed, is pleasure; but the involuntary
is pain. Men also, who have the political virtues,
give intension and remission to these, co-harmonizing
the other parts of the soul, to that part which
possesses reason. But the boundary of this co-adaptation,
is for intellect not to be prevented from
accomplishing its proper work, either by indigence,
or excess. For that which is less excellent, is co-arranged
for the sake of that which is more excellent.
<span class="pb" id="Page_225">225</span>
Thus in the world, every part that is always passive,
subsists for the sake of that which is always moved.
And in the conjunction of animals, the female subsists
for the sake of the male. For the latter sows,
generating a soul; but the former alone imparts
matter to that which is generated. In the soul
however, the irrational subsists for the sake of the
rational part. For anger and desire are co-arranged
in subserviency to the first part of the soul; the
former as a certain satellite, and guardian of the
body; but the latter as a dispensator and provident
curator of necessary wants. But intellect being
established in the highest summit of the body, and
having a prospect in that which is on all sides
splendid and transparent,<a class="fn" id="fr_65" href="#fn_65">[65]</a> investigates the wisdom
of [real] beings. And this is the work of it according
<span class="pb" id="Page_226">226</span>
to nature, viz. having investigated, and obtained
the possession [of truth] to follow those beings who
are more excellent and more honorable than itself.
For <i>the knowledge of things divine and most honorable,
is the principle, cause, and rule of human
blessedness</i>.</p>

<br />CONCERNING VIRTUE.</h2>
<p>The virtue of man is the perfection of the nature
of man. For every being becomes perfect, and
arrives at the summit of excellence according to the
proper nature of its virtue. Thus the virtue of a
horse, is that which leads the nature of a horse to
its summit. And the same reasoning is applicable
to the several parts of a thing. Thus the virtue of
the eyes is acuteness of vision: and this in the nature
of the eyes is the summit. The virtue of the
ears also, is acuteness of hearing: and this is the
summit of the nature of the ears. Thus too, the
virtue of the feet is swiftness: and this is the summit
of the nature of the feet. It is necessary however,
that every virtue should have these three
things, reason, power, and deliberate choice; reason
<span class="pb" id="Page_228">228</span>
indeed, by which it judges and contemplates;
power, by which it prohibits and vanquishes; and
deliberate choice, by which it loves and delights in
[what is proper]. To judge therefore, and contemplate,
pertain to the dianoetic part of the soul; but
to prohibit and vanquish are the peculiarity of the
irrational<a class="fn" id="fr_66" href="#fn_66">[66]</a> part of the soul; and to love and delight
in what is proper, pertain to both the rational
and irrational parts. For deliberate choice consists
of dianoia [or the discursive energy of reason] and
appetite. Dianoia therefore, belongs to the rational,
but appetite to the irrational part of the
soul. The multitude however, of all the virtues,
may be perceived from the parts of the soul; and
in a similar manner the generation and nature of
virtue. For of the parts of the soul, there are two
that rank as the first, viz. the rational and the irrational
parts. And the rational part indeed, is that
by which we judge and contemplate; but the irrational
<span class="pb" id="Page_229">229</span>
part is that by which we are impelled and
desire. These however, are either concordant or
discordant with each other. But the contest and
dissonance between them, are produced through
excess and defect. It is evident therefore, that
when the rational vanquishes the irrational part of
the soul, endurance and continence are produced;
and that when the former leads, and the latter
follows, and both accord with each other, then
virtue is generated. Hence, endurance and continence
are generated accompanied with pain; but
endurance resists pain, and continence pleasure.
Incontinence however, and effeminacy, neither resist
nor vanquish [pleasure]. And on this account
it happens that men fly from good through pain,
but reject it through pleasure. Praise likewise,
and blame, and every thing beautiful in human
conduct are produced in these parts of the soul.
And in short, the nature of virtue derives its subsistence
after this manner.</p>
<p>The species however, and the parts of it, may be
surveyed as follows: Since there are two parts of
the soul, the rational and the irrational; the latter is
divided into the irascible and appetitive. And the
rational part, indeed, is that by which we judge and
contemplate; but the irrational part is that by
which we are impelled and desire. And of this,
that which is as it were adapted to defend us, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_230">230</span>
revenge incidental molestations, is denominated the
irascible part; but that which is as it were orectic
of, and desires to preserve the proper constitution
of the body, is the appetitive part. It is evident
therefore, that the multitude of the virtues, their
differences, and their peculiarities, follow conformably
to these parts of the soul.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">231</div>
<h2 id="c44"><span class="small">FROM CLINIAS.</span></h2>
<p>Every virtue is perfected, as was shown by us in
the beginning, from reason, deliberate choice, and
power. Each of these, however, is not by itself a
part of virtue, but the cause of it.
<a id="er26" href="#en26">Such therefore, as have the intellective and gnostic part of virtue</a>,<a class="fn" id="fr_67" href="#fn_67">[67]</a>
are denominated skilful and intelligent; but such
as have the ethical and pre-elective part of it, are
denominated useful and equitable.<a class="fn" id="fr_68" href="#fn_68">[68]</a> Since however,
man is naturally adapted to act unjustly from
exciting causes; and these are three, the love of
pleasure in corporeal enjoyments; avarice, in the
accumulation of wealth; and ambition, in surpassing
those that are equal and similar to him;&mdash;this being
the case, it is necessary to know, that it is possible
to oppose to these such things as procure fear,
shame, and desire in men; viz. fear through the
laws, shame through the Gods, and desire through
<span class="pb" id="Page_232">232</span>
the energies of reason. Hence, it is necessary that
youth should be taught from the first to honor the
Gods and the laws. For from these, it will be
manifest, that every human work, and every kind of
human life, by the participation of sanctity and
piety, will sail prosperously [over the sea of generation].</p>

<br />THEAGES,
<br /><span class="smallest">IN HIS TREATISE</span>
<br />ON THE VIRTUES.</h2>
<p>The principles of all virtue are three; knowledge,
power, and deliberate choice. And knowledge indeed,
is that by which we contemplate and form a
judgment of things; power is as it were a certain
strength of the nature<a class="fn" id="fr_69" href="#fn_69">[69]</a> from which we derive our
subsistence, and is that which gives stability to our
actions; and deliberate choice is as it were certain
hands of the soul by which we are impelled to, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_234">234</span>
lay hold on the objects of our choice. The order
of the soul also subsists as follows: One part of it
is the reasoning power, another part is anger, and
another is desire. And the reasoning power indeed,
is that which has dominion over knowledge;
anger is that which rules over the ardent impulses
of the soul; and desire is that which willingly rules
over appetite. When therefore, these three pass
into one, so as to exhibit one co-adaptation, then virtue
and concord are produced in the soul; but when
they are seditious, and divulsed from each other,
then vice and discord are generated in the soul.
And when the reasoning power prevails over the
irrational parts of the soul, then endurance and
continence are produced; endurance indeed, in the
retention of pains; but continence in the abstinence
from pleasures. But when the irrational
parts of the soul prevail over the reasoning power,
then effeminacy and incontinence are produced;
effeminacy indeed, in flying from pain; but incontinence,
in the being vanquished by pleasures.
When however, the better part of the soul governs,
but the less excellent part is governed; and the
former leads, but the latter follows, and both consent,
and are concordant with each other, then virtue
and every good are generated in the whole
soul. When likewise the appetitive follows the
reasoning part of the soul, then temperance is produced;
but when this is the case with the irascible
<span class="pb" id="Page_235">235</span>
part, fortitude is produced; and when it takes
place in all the parts of the soul, then justice is the
result. For justice is that which separates all the
vices and all the virtues of the soul from each
other. And justice is a certain established order
of the apt conjunction of the parts of the soul, and
perfect and supreme virtue. For every good is
contained in this; but the other goods of the soul
cannot subsist without this. Hence justice possesses
great strength both among Gods and men.
For this virtue contains the bond by which the
whole and the universe are held together, and
also by which Gods and men are connected. Justice
therefore, is said to be Themis among the celestial,
but Dice among the terrestrial Gods; and
Law among men. These assertions however, are
indications and symbols, that justice is the supreme
virtue. Hence virtue, when it consists in
contemplating and judging, is called prudence;
when in sustaining things of a dreadful nature, it is
denominated fortitude; when in restraining pleasure,
temperance; and when in abstaining from
gain, and from injuring our neighbours, justice.</p>
<p>Moreover, the arrangement of virtue according
to right reason, and the transgression of it contrary
to right reason, produce [in the former case] a tendency
to the decorous as the final mark, and [in
the latter] the frustration of it. The decorous
however, is that which ought to be. But this does
<span class="pb" id="Page_236">236</span>
not require either addition or ablation; since it is
that which it is requisite to be. But of the indecorous
there are two species; one of which is excess,
and the other defect. And excess indeed, is
more, but deficiency is less, than is decorous.
Virtue also, is a certain habit of the decorous.
Hence it is directly, both a summit and a medium.
For thus, things that are decorous are both media
and summits. They are media indeed, because
they fall between excess and deficiency; but they
are summits, because they do not require either
addition or ablation. For they are the very things
themselves which they ought to be.</p>
<p>Since however, the virtue of manners is conversant
with the passions, but of the passions pleasure
and pain are supreme, it is evident that virtue
does not consist in extirpating the passions of the
soul, pleasure and pain, but in co-harmonizing
them. For neither does health, which is a certain
apt mixture of the powers of the body, consist in
expelling the cold and the hot, the moist and the
dry; but in these being [appropriately] mingled
together. For it is as it were, a certain symmetry
of these. Thus too, in music, concord does not
consist in expelling the sharp and the flat; but
when these are co-harmonized, then concord is produced,
and dissonance is exterminated. In a similar
manner, the hot and the cold, the moist and the
dry, being harmoniously mingled together, health
<span class="pb" id="Page_237">237</span>
is produced, and disease destroyed. But when
anger, and desire are co-harmonized, the vices and
the [other] passions are extirpated, and the virtues
and manners are ingenerated. Deliberate choice
however, in beautiful conduct, is the greatest peculiarity
of the virtue of manners. For it is possible
to use reason and power without virtue; but it is
not possible to use deliberate choice without it.
For deliberate choice indicates the dignity of manners.
Hence also, the reasoning power subduing
<i>by force</i> anger and desire, produces continence and
endurance. And again, when the reasoning power
is violently dethroned by the irrational parts, then
incontinence and effeminacy are produced. Such
dispositions however, of the soul as these, are
half-perfect virtues, and half-perfect vices. For
the reasoning power of the soul is [according to its
natural subsistence] in a healthy, but the irrational
parts are in a diseased condition. And so far indeed,
as anger and desire are governed and led by
the rational part of the soul, continence and endurance
become virtues; but so far as this is effected
by violence, and not voluntarily, they become vices.
For it is necessary that virtue should perform such
things as are fit, not with pain, but with pleasure.
Again, so far as anger and desire govern the reasoning
power, effeminacy and incontinence are produced,
which are certain vices. But so far, as they gratify
the passions with pain, knowing that they are erroneous,
<span class="pb" id="Page_238">238</span>
in consequence of the eye of the soul being
sane,&mdash;so far as this is the case, they are not vices.
Hence, it is evident that virtue must necessarily
perform what is fit voluntarily; that which is involuntary
indeed, not being without pain and fear;
and that which is voluntary, not subsisting without
pleasure and delight.</p>
<p>By division also it will at the same time be found
that this is the case. For knowledge and the perception
of things, are the province of the rational
part of the soul; but power pertains to the irrational
part. For not to be able to resist pain, or
to vanquish pleasure, is the peculiarity of the irrational
part of the soul. But deliberate choice subsists
in both these, viz. in the rational; and also in
the irrational part. For it consists of dianoia and
appetite; of which, dianoia indeed, pertains to the
rational, but appetite to the irrational part. Hence
every virtue consists in a co-adaptation of the parts
of the soul; and both will and deliberate choice,
entirely subsist in virtue.</p>
<p>Universally therefore, virtue is a certain co-adaptation
of the irrational parts of the soul to the
rational part. Virtue however, is produced
through pleasure and pain receiving the boundary
of that which is fit. For true virtue is nothing
else than the habit of that which is fit. But the
fit, or the decorous, is that which ought to be;
and the unfit, or indecorous, is that which ought
<span class="pb" id="Page_239">239</span>
not to be. Of the indecorous however, there are
two species, viz. excess and defect. And excess
indeed, is more than is fit; but defect is less than
is fit. But since the fit is that which ought to be,
it is both a summit and a middle. It is a summit
indeed, because it neither requires ablation, nor
addition; but it is a middle, because it subsists between
excess and defect. The fit, however, and
the unfit, are to each other as the equal and the
unequal that which is arranged, and that which is
without arrangement; and both the two former and
the two latter are finite and infinite.<a class="fn" id="fr_70" href="#fn_70">[70]</a> On this account,
the parts of the unequal are referred to the middle,
but not to each other. For the angle is called obtuse
which is greater than a right angle; but that
is called acute, which is less than a right angle.
The right line also [in a circle] is greater, which
surpasses that which is drawn from the center.
And the day is longer indeed, which exceeds that
of the equinox. Diseases, likewise, of the body are
generated, through the body becoming more hot or
more cold [than is proper]. For that which is
more hot [than is fit] exceeds moderation; and that
<span class="pb" id="Page_240">240</span>
which is more cold [than is fit] is below mediocrity.
The soul also, and such things as pertain to it,
have this disposition and analogy. For audacity
indeed, is an excess of the decorous in the endurance
of things of a dreadful nature; but timidity
is a deficiency of the, decorous. And prodigality
is an excess of what is fit in the expenditure of
money; but illiberality is a deficiency in this. And
rage indeed, is an excess of the decorous in the
impulse of the irascible part of the soul; but insensibility
is a deficiency of this. The same reasoning
likewise applies to the opposition of the
other dispositions of the soul. It is necessary however,
that virtue, since it is a habit of the decorous,
and a medium of the passions, should neither be
[wholly] impassive, nor immoderately passive. For
impassivity indeed, causes the soul to be unimpelled,
and to be without an enthusiastic tendency
to the beautiful in conduct; but immoderate passivity
causes it to be full of perturbation, and inconsiderate.
It is necessary therefore, that passion
should so present itself to the view, in virtue,
as shadow and outline in a picture. For the animated
and the delicate, and that which imitates the
truth, in conjunction with goodness of colors, are
especially effected in a picture through these [i.&nbsp;e.
through shadow and outline]. But the passions of
the soul are animated by the natural incitation and
enthusiasm of virtue. For virtue is generated
<span class="pb" id="Page_241">241</span>
from the passions, and when generated, again subsists
together with them; just as that which is well
harmonized consists of the sharp and the flat, that
which is well mingled consists of the hot and the
cold, and that which is in equilibrium derives its
equality of weight from the heavy and the light.
It is not therefore necessary to take away the passions
of the soul; for neither would this be profitable;
but it is requisite that they should be co-harmonized
with the rational part, in conjunction
with fitness and mediocrity.</p>

<h2 id="c46"><span class="small"><span class="smallest">FROM</span></span>
<br /><span class="smallest">THE TREATISE OF</span>
<br />ARCHYTAS
<br />ON ETHICAL ERUDITION.</h2>
<p>I say that virtue will be found sufficient to the
avoidance of infelicity, and vice to the non-attainment
of felicity, if we judiciously consider the habits
[by which these are produced]. For it is necessary
that the bad man should always be miserable;
whether he is in affluence, for he employs it
badly; or whether he is in penury; just as the
blind man, whether he has light, and the most
splendid visible object before him, or whether he is
in the dark [is always necessarily without sight].
But the good man is not always happy; for felicity
does not consist in the possession, but in the
use of virtue. For neither does he who has sight
always see; for he will not see, if he is without
light. Life, however, is divided into two paths;
one of which is more arduous, and in which the
<span class="pb" id="Page_243">243</span>
patient Ulysses walked; but the other is more free
from molestation, and is that in which Nestor proceeded.
I say therefore that virtue desires the
latter, but is able to proceed in the former of these
paths. The nature however of felicity proclaims
it to be a desirable and stable life, because it gives
perfection to the decision of the soul. Hence the
virtuous man who does not obtain such a life as
this, is not indeed happy, nor yet entirely miserable.
No one therefore will dare to say that the
good man should be exempt from disease, and pain,
and sorrow. For as we leave certain painful things
to the body, so likewise we must permit them to
be present with the soul. The sorrows, however,
of fools are most irrational; but those of wise men
proceed only as far as reason, which gives limitation
to things, permits. Moreover, the boast of
apathy dissolves the generosity of virtue, when it
opposes itself to things of an indifferent nature, and
not to evils such as death, and pain, and poverty.
For things which are not evils are easily vanquished.
We should therefore exercise ourselves
in the mediocrity of the passions, as we shall then
equally avoid insensibility, and too much passivity,
and shall not speak higher of our nature than we
ought.</p>

<p>I say then that the good man is one who uses in
a beautiful manner great things and opportunities.
He likewise is able to bear well both prosperity and
adversity. In beautiful and honorable circumstances
also, he becomes worthy of the condition
in which he is placed; and when his fortune is
changed, receives it in a proper manner. In short,
on all occasions, he contends well from contingencies
that may arise. Nor does he only thus
prepare himself [for whatever may happen], but
likewise those who confide in and contend together
with him.</p>

<br />CRITO,
<br /><span class="smallest">IN HIS TREATISE ON</span>
<br />PRUDENCE AND PROSPERITY.</h2>
<p>Prudence and prosperity subsist, with reference
to each other, as follows: Prudence indeed is effable
and possesses reason; for it is something orderly
and definite. But prosperity is ineffable and
irrational; for it is something disorderly and indefinite.
And prudence, indeed, is prior, but prosperity
is posterior in beginning and in power. For
the former is naturally adapted to govern and define;
but the latter to be governed and defined.
Moreover, both prudence and prosperity receive
co-adaptation, since they concur in one and the
same thing. For it is always necessary that the
thing which bounds and co-arranges, should have a
nature which is effable and participates of reason;
but that the thing which is bounded and co-arranged,
should be naturally ineffable and irrational.
<span class="pb" id="Page_246">246</span>
For the reason of the nature of the infinite and of
that which bounds, thus subsists in all things. For
infinites are always naturally disposed to be
bounded and co-arranged by things which possess
reason and prudence, since the former have the
order of matter and essence with relation to the
latter. But finites are co-arranged and bounded
from themselves, since they have the order of
cause, and of that which is energetic.</p>
<p>The co-adaptation, however, of these natures in
different things, produces a great and various difference
of co-adapted substances. For in the comprehension
of the whole of things, the co-adaptation
of both the natures, i.&nbsp;e. of the nature which
is always moved, and of that which is always passive,
is the world. For it is not possible for the
whole and the universe to be otherwise saved, than
by that which is generated being co-adapted to that
which is divine, and that which is always passive
to that which is always moved.<a class="fn" id="fr_71" href="#fn_71">[71]</a> In man, likewise,
the co-adaptation of the irrational to the rational
part of the soul, is virtue. For it is not possible in
these, when there is sedition in both the parts, that
virtue should have a subsistence. In a city also,
the co-adaptation of the governors to the governed,
produces strength and concord. For to govern
<span class="pb" id="Page_247">247</span>
is the peculiarity of the better nature; but to be
governed, is easier to the subordinate [than to the
more excellent] nature. And strength and concord
are common to both. There is, however, the same
mode of adaptation in the universe and in a family:
for allurements<a class="fn" id="fr_72" href="#fn_72">[72]</a>
and erudition concur with reason
in one and the same thing; and likewise pains and
pleasures, prosperity and adversity. For the life
of man requires intension and remission, sorrow
and gladness, prosperity and adversity. For some
things are able to collect and retain the intellect to
industry and wisdom; but others impart relaxation
and delight, and thus render the intellect vigorous
and prompt to action. If however one of these
prevails in life, then the life of man becomes of
one part, and verges to one part, tending either to
sorrow and difficulty, or to remission and levity.
But the co-adaptation of all these ought to subsist
with reference to prudence. For this separates
and distinguishes<a class="fn" id="fr_73" href="#fn_73">[73]</a> bound and infinity in actions.
Hence prudence is the leader and mother of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_248">248</span>
other virtues. For all of them are co-harmonized
and co-arranged with reference to the reason and
law of this virtue. And now my discussion of this
subject is terminated. For the irrational and the
effable are in all things. And the latter defines
and bounds; but the former is defined and
bounded. That, however, which consists of both
these, is the apt composition of the whole and the
universe.</p>

<p class="tb">God fashioned man in such a way as to render
it manifest, that he is not through the want of
power, or of deliberate choice, incapable of being
impelled to what is beautiful in conduct. For he
implanted in him a principle of such a kind as to
comprehend at one and the same time the possible
and the pre-eligible; so that man might be the
cause of power, and the possession of good, but
<span class="pb" id="Page_249">249</span>
God of impulse and incitation according to right
reason. On this account also, he made him tend
to heaven, gave him an intellective power, and implanted
in him a sight called intellect, which is capable
of beholding God. For it is not possible
without God to discover that which is best and
most beautiful, nor without intellect to see God,
since every mortal nature is established in conjunction
with a kindred privation of intellect. This
however is not imparted to it by God, but by the
essence of generation, and by that impulse of the
soul which is without deliberate choice.</p>

<p>The prudent [i.&nbsp;e. the wise] man will especially
become so as follows: In the first place, being
naturally sagacious, possessing a good memory, and
being a lover of labor, he should exercise his dianoetic
power immediately from his youth in reasonings
and disciplines, and in accurate theories,
and adhere to genuine philosophy. But after this
he should acquire knowledge and experience in
what pertains to the Gods, the laws, and human
lives. For there are two things from which the
disposition of prudence is produced; one of which
consists in obtaining a mathematical and gnostic
habit; but the other, in a man perceiving by himself
many theorems and things, and understanding
other things through a certain different mode. For
neither is he sufficient to the possession of prudence,
<span class="pb" id="Page_251">251</span>
who immediately from his youth has exercised
his dianoetic power in reasonings and disciplines;
nor he who being destitute of these, has
heard and has been conversant with a multitude of
things. But the latter will have his dianoetic
power blind, through judging of particulars; and
the former through always surveying universals.
For as in computations the amount of the whole is
obtained by the addition of the parts, thus also in
things, reason is able to delineate the theory of universals;
but experience has the power of forming a
judgment of particulars.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_252">252</div>

<br />ARCHYTAS,

<br />ON DISCIPLINES.</h2>
<p>It is necessary that you should become scientific,
either by learning from another person, or by discovering
yourself the things of which you have a
scientific knowledge. If, therefore, you learn from
another person, that which you learn is foreign; but
what you discover yourself is through yourself, and
is your own. Moreover, if you investigate, discovery
will be easy, and soon obtained; but if you
do not know how to investigate, discovery will be
to you impossible. And [right] reasoning indeed,
when discovered, causes sedition to cease, and increases
concord. For through this the inexhaustible
desire of possessing is suppressed, and equality
prevails; since by this we obtain what is just in
contracts. Hence, on account of this, the poor receive
from those who are able to give; and the rich
<span class="pb" id="Page_253">253</span>
give to those that are in want, both of them believing
that through this they shall obtain the equal.
This however will be a rule and an impediment to
those that act unjustly, viz. that men who possess
scientific knowledge will appease their anger, prior
to the commission of an injury, being persuaded
that the perpetrators of it will not be concealed
when it is committed; but that those who do not
possess scientific knowledge, becoming manifest
in the commission of an injury, will be restrained
from acting unjustly.</p>

<p>It appears to me that the justice which subsists
among men, may be called the mother and the
nurse of the other virtues. For without this a
man can neither be temperate, nor brave, nor prudent.
For it is the harmony and peace, in conjunction
with elegance, of the whole soul. The
strength however of this virtue will become more
manifest, if we direct our attention to the other
habits. For they have a partial utility, and which
is referred to one thing; but this is referred to
whole systems, and to a multitude. In the world
therefore, it conducts the whole government of
things, and is providence, harmony, and Dice, by
the decree of a certain genus of Gods. But in a
city it is justly called peace, and equitable legislation.
And in a house, it is the concord between
<span class="pb" id="Page_255">255</span>
the husband and wife; the benevolence of the servant
towards the master; and the anxious care of
the master for the welfare of the servant. In the
body likewise, which is the first and dearest thing
to all animals, [so far as they are animals,] it is the
health and intireness of all the parts. But in the
soul, it is the wisdom, which among men subsists
from science and justice. If therefore, this virtue
thus disciplines and saves both the whole and the
parts [of every thing] rendering things concordant
and familiar with each other, how is it possible it
should not be called by the decision of all men, the
mother and the nurse of all things?</p>

<p class="revint">The following fragments also, from the Treatise
of Archytas on Wisdom, are preserved by
Iamblichus, in the 3rd Chapter of his Protreptics,
or Exhortations to Philosophy.</p>
<p class="tb">&ldquo;Archytas therefore, in the beginning of his
Treatise on Wisdom, exhorts to the possession of it
as follows:</p>
<p>1. &ldquo;Wisdom as much excels in all human affairs
as the sight does the [other] corporeal senses, intellect
the soul, and the sun the stars. For the sight
is the most far-darting, and the most multiform of
all the senses; intellect is the supreme part of the
soul, judging by reason and diano&iuml;a what is fit, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_256">256</span>
existing as the sight and power of the most honorable
things; and the sun is the eye and soul of
things which have a natural subsistence. For
through it all things become visible, are generated,
and rise into existence.<a class="fn" id="fr_74" href="#fn_74">[74]</a> Deriving also their roots,
and being generated from thence, they are nourished,
increased and excited by it in conjunction with
sense.</p>
<p>2. &ldquo;Man was generated by far the wisest of all
[terrestrial] animals. For he is able to contemplate
the things which exist, and to obtain from all things
science and wisdom. To which also it may be
added, that divinity has engraved and exhibited in
him the system of universal reason, in which all the
forms of things in existence are distributed, and the
significations of nouns and verbs. For a place is
assigned for the sounds of the voice, viz. the pharynx,
the mouth, and the nostrils. But as man
was generated the instrument of the sounds, through
which nouns and verbs are signified, so likewise of
the conceptions which are beheld in the things that
have an existence. And this appears to me to be
the work of wisdom, for the accomplishment of
which man was generated and constituted, and
received organs and powers from divinity.</p>
<p>3. &ldquo;Man was generated and constituted, for the
purpose of contemplating the reason of the whole
<span class="pb" id="Page_257">257</span>
of nature, and in order that, being himself the work
of wisdom, he might survey the wisdom of the
things which exist.&mdash;For if the reason of man is
contemplative of the reason of the whole of nature,
and the wisdom also of man perceives and contemplates
the wisdom of the things in existence,&mdash;this
being acknowledged, it is at the same time demonstrated,
that man is a part of universal reason, and
of the whole of the intellectual nature.</p>
<p>4. &ldquo;Wisdom is not conversant with a certain
definite existing thing, but is simply conversant with
all the things that exist. And it is requisite, that
it should not first investigate the principles of itself,
but the common principles of all beings. For wisdom
so subsists with reference to all beings, that it
is the province of it to know and contemplate the
universal accidents of all things. And on this account
wisdom discovers the principles of all
beings.</p>
<p>5. &ldquo;Whoever, therefore, is able to analyze all
the genera which are contained under one and the
same principle, and again to compose and con-numerate
them, he appears to me to be the wisest of
men, and to possess the most perfect veracity.
Farther still, he will also have discovered a beautiful
place of survey, from which it will be possible
to behold divinity, and all things that are in co-ordination
with, and successive to him, subsisting
<span class="pb" id="Page_258">258</span>
separately, or distinct from each other.<a class="fn" id="fr_75" href="#fn_75">[75]</a> Having
likewise entered this most ample road, being impelled
in a right direction by intellect, and having
arrived at the end of his course, he will have conjoined
beginnings with ends, and will know that
God is the principle, middle, and end, of all things
which are accomplished according to justice and
right reason.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_76" href="#fn_76">[76]</a></p>

<p>Pythagoras said, it is requisite to choose the

Wealth is an infirm anchor, glory is still

Prudence, magnanimity, fortitude. These no

virtue is the only thing that is strong; and that
every thing else is a trifle.</p>
<p>All the parts of human life, in the same manner
as those of a statue, ought to be beautiful.</p>
<p>A statue indeed standing on its basis, but a worthy

<p>Frankincense ought to be given to the Gods,

<p>It is requisite to defend those who are unjustly
accused of having acted injuriously, but to praise
those who excel in a certain good.</p>
<p>Neither will the horse be judged to be generous,

<p>Those things which the body necessarily requires,
are easily to be procured by all men, without labor
and molestation; but those things to the attainment
of which labor and molestation are requisite,
are objects of desire, not to the body, but to
depraved opinion. Aristoxenus Pythag. Stob.
p. 132.</p>
<p>Of desire also, he [i.&nbsp;e. Pythagoras] said as follows:
This passion is various, laborious, and very
multiform. Of desires however, some are acquired
and adventitious, but others are connascent. But
he defined desire itself to be a certain tendency and
impulse of the soul, and an appetite of a plenitude
or presence of sense, or of an emptiness and absence
of it, and of non-perception. He also said, that
there are three most known species of erroneous
and depraved desire, viz. the indecorous, the incommensurate,
and the unseasonable. For desire is
either immediately indecorous, troublesome, and
illiberal; or it is not absolutely so, but is more vehement
and lasting than is fit. Or in the third
place, it is impelled when it is not proper; and to
objects to which it ought not to tend. Ex Aristoxeni

<p>It is not so difficult to err, as not to reprove him

<p>As a bodily disease cannot be healed, if it is
concealed, or praised; thus also, neither can a remedy
be applied to a diseased soul, which is badly
guarded and protected. Pythagoras. Stob. p.

<p>The grace of freedom of speech, like beauty in
season, is productive of greater delight.</p>
<p>It is not proper either to have a blunt sword, or
to use freedom of speech ineffectually.</p>
<p>Neither is the sun to be taken from the world,
nor freedom of speech from erudition.</p>
<p>As it is possible for one who is clothed with a
sordid robe, to have a good habit of body; thus
also he whose life is poor may possess freedom of
speech.<a class="fn" id="fr_84" href="#fn_84">[84]</a></p>

<p>Travelling teaches a man frugality, and the way
in which he may be sufficient to himself. For
bread made of milk and flower, and a bed of grass,

of residence; for the whole world is the country of
the worthy soul.<a class="fn" id="fr_86" href="#fn_86">[86]</a> Stob. p. 231.</p>

<p>To neglect things of the smallest consequence, is
not the least thing in human life.</p>
<p>The wise man, and the despiser of wealth, resembles
God.</p>
<p>Do not investigate the name of God, because
you will not find it. For every thing which is
called by a name, receives its appellation from that
which is more worthy than itself,<a class="fn" id="fr_90" href="#fn_90">[90]</a> so that it is one
<span class="pb" id="Page_269">269</span>
person that calls, and another that hears. Who is
it, therefore, that has given a name to God? God,
however, is not a name to God, but an indication
of what we conceive of him.</p>
<p>God is a light incapable of receiving its contrary
[darkness.]</p>
<p>You have in yourself something similar to God,
and therefore use yourself as the temple of God, on
account of that which in you resembles God.</p>
<p>Honor God above all things, that he may rule
over you.</p>
<p>Whatever you honor above all things, that which
you so honor will have dominion over you. But
if you give yourself to the domination of God, you
will thus have dominion over all things.</p>
<p>The greatest honor which can be paid to God,
is to know and imitate him.</p>
<p>There is not any thing, indeed, which wholly resembles
God; nevertheless the imitation of him as
much as possible by an inferior nature is grateful
to him.</p>
<p>God, indeed, is not in want of any thing, but the
wise man is in want of God alone. He, therefore,
who is in want but of few things, and those necessary,
emulates him who is in want of nothing.</p>
<p>Endeavour to be great in the estimation of divinity,
but among men avoid envy.</p>
<p>The wise man whose estimation with men was
<span class="pb" id="Page_270">270</span>
but small while he was living, will be renowned
when he is dead.</p>
<p>Consider all the time to be lost to you in which
you do not think of divinity.</p>
<p>A good intellect is the choir of divinity.</p>
<p>A bad intellect is the choir of evil d&aelig;mons.</p>
<p>Honor that which is just, on this very account
that it is just.</p>
<p>You will not be concealed from divinity when
you act unjustly, nor even when you think of
acting so.</p>
<p>The foundation of piety is continence; but the
summit of piety is the love of God.</p>
<p>Wish that what is expedient and not what is
pleasing may happen to you.</p>
<p>Such as you wish your neighbour to be to you,
such also be you to your neighbours.</p>
<p>That which God gives you, no one can take
away.</p>
<p>Neither do nor even think of that which you are
not willing God should know.</p>
<p>Before you do any thing think of God, that his
light may precede your energies.</p>
<p>The soul is illuminated by the recollection of
deity.</p>
<p>The use of all animals as food is indifferent, but
it is more rational to abstain from them.</p>
<p>God is not the author of any evil.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_271">271</div>
<p>You should not possess more than the use of
the body requires.</p>
<p>Possess those things which no one can take from
you.</p>
<p>Bear that which is necessary, as it is necessary.</p>
<p>Ask those things of God which it is worthy of
God to bestow.</p>
<p>The reason which is in you, is the light of your
life.</p>
<p>Ask those things of God, which you cannot receive
from man.</p>
<p>Wish that those things which labor ought to precede,
may be possessed by you after labor.</p>
<p>Be not anxious to please the multitude.</p>
<p>It is not proper to despise those things of which
we shall be in want after the dissolution<a class="fn" id="fr_91" href="#fn_91">[91]</a> of the
body.</p>
<p>You should not ask of divinity that which, when
you have obtained, you will not perpetually possess.</p>
<p>Accustom your soul after [it has conceived all
that is great of] divinity, to conceive something
great of itself.</p>
<p>Esteem nothing to be precious, which a bad man
may take from you.</p>
<p>He is dear to divinity, who considers those
<span class="pb" id="Page_272">272</span>
things alone to be precious, which are esteemed to
be so by divinity.</p>
<p>Every thing which is more than necessary to
man, is hostile to him.</p>
<p>He who loves that which is not expedient, will
not love that which is expedient.</p>
<p>The intellect of the wise man is always with divinity.</p>
<p>God dwells in the intellect of the wise man.</p>
<p>Every desire is insatiable, and therefore is always
in want.</p>
<p>The wise man is always similar to himself.</p>
<p>The knowledge and imitation of divinity, are
alone sufficient to beatitude.</p>
<p>Use lying as poison.</p>
<p>Nothing is so peculiar to wisdom as truth.</p>
<p>When you preside over men, remember that
divinity also presides over you.</p>
<p>Be persuaded that the end of life, is to live conformably
to divinity.</p>
<p>Depraved affections are the beginnings of sorrows.</p>
<p>An evil disposition is the disease of the soul;
but injustice and impiety are the death of it.</p>
<p>Use all men in such a way, as if you were the
common curator of all things after God.</p>
<p>He who uses mankind badly, uses himself badly.</p>
<p>Wish that you may be able to benefit your enemies.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_273">273</div>
<p>Endure all things, in order that you may live
conformably to God.</p>
<p>By honoring a wise man, you will honor yourself.</p>
<p>In all your actions place God before your eyes.<a class="fn" id="fr_92" href="#fn_92">[92]</a></p>
<p>You are permitted to refuse matrimony, in order
that you may live incessantly adhering to God.<a class="fn" id="fr_93" href="#fn_93">[93]</a>
If, however, as one knowing the battle, you are
willing to fight, take a wife, and beget children.</p>
<p>To live, indeed, is not in our power, but to live
rightly is.</p>
<p>Be unwilling to admit accusations against the
man who is studious of wisdom.</p>
<p>If you wish to live with hilarity, be unwilling to
do many things. For in a multitude of actions you
will be minor.</p>
<p>Every cup should be sweet to you which extinguishes
thirst.</p>
<p>Fly from intoxication as you would from insanity.</p>
<p>No good originates from the body.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_274">274</div>
<p>Think that you suffer a great punishment when
you obtain the object of corporeal desire; for the
attainment of such objects never satisfies desire.</p>
<p>Invoke God as a witness to whatever you do.</p>
<p>The bad man does not think there is a providence.</p>
<p>Assert that which possesses wisdom in you, to
be the [true] man.<a class="fn" id="fr_94" href="#fn_94">[94]</a></p>
<p>The wise man participates of God.</p>
<p>Where that which is wise in you resides, there
also is your good.</p>
<p>That which is not noxious to the soul, is not
noxious to man.</p>
<p>He who unjustly expels a wise man from the
body, confers a benefit on him by his iniquity. For
he thus becomes liberated as it were, from bonds.</p>
<p>The fear of death renders a man sad through the
ignorance of his soul.</p>
<p>You will not possess intellect, till you understand
that you have it.</p>
<p>Think that your body is the garment of your
soul; and therefore preserve it pure.</p>
<p>Impure d&aelig;mons vindicate to themselves the impure
soul.</p>
<p>Speak not of God to every man.</p>
<p>It is dangerous, and the danger is not small, to
speak of God even things which are true.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_275">275</div>
<p>A true assertion respecting God, is an assertion
of God.</p>
<p>You should not dare to speak of God to the
multitude.</p>
<p>He does not know God who does not worship
him.</p>
<p>The man who is worthy of God is also a God
among men.</p>
<p>It is better to have nothing, than to possess much
and impart it to no one.</p>
<p>He who thinks that there is a God, and that nothing
is taken care of by him, differs in no respect
from him who does not believe that there is a
God.</p>
<p>He honors God in the best manner who renders
his intellect as much as possible similar to
God.</p>
<p>If you injure no one, you will fear no one.</p>
<p>No one is wise who looks downward to the
earth.</p>
<p>To lie is to deceive in life, and to be deceived.</p>
<p>Recognise what God is, and what that is in you
which recognises God.</p>
<p>It is not death, but a bad life, that destroys the
soul.</p>
<p>If you know him by whom you were made, you
will know yourself.</p>
<p>It is not possible for a man to live conformable
<span class="pb" id="Page_276">276</span>
to divinity, unless he acts modestly, well, and
justly.</p>
<p>Divine wisdom is true science.</p>
<p>You should not dare to speak of God to an impure
soul.</p>
<p>The wise man follows God, and God follows the
soul of the wise man.</p>
<p>A king rejoices in those whom he governs, and
therefore God rejoices in the wise man. He who
governs likewise, is inseparable from those whom
he governs; and therefore God is inseparable from
the soul of the wise man, which he defends and
governs.</p>
<p>The wise man is governed by God, and on this
account is blessed.</p>
<p>A scientific knowledge of God causes a man to
use few words.</p>
<p>To use many words when speaking of God, produces
an ignorance of God.</p>
<p>The man who possesses a knowledge of God,
will not be very ambitious.</p>
<p>The erudite,<a class="fn" id="fr_95" href="#fn_95">[95]</a> chaste, and wise soul, is the prophet

by rust, or virtue by baseness.</p>
<p>We should betake ourselves to virtue as to an
inviolable temple, in order that we may not be exposed
to any ignoble insolence of soul with respect
to our communion with, and continuance in life.</p>
<p>We should confide in Virtue as in a chaste wife;
but trust to Fortune as to an inconstant mistress.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_279">279</div>
<p>It is better that virtue should be received accompanied
with poverty, than wealth with violence;
and frugality with health, than veracity with disease.</p>
<p>An abundance of nutriment is noxious to the
body; but the body is preserved when the soul is
disposed in a becoming manner.</p>
<p>It is equally dangerous to give a sword to a madman,
and power to a depraved man.</p>
<p>As it is better for a part of the body which contains
purulent matter to be burnt, than to continue
in the state in which it is, thus also it is better for
a depraved man to die than to live.</p>
<p><a id="er27" href="#en27">The theorems of philosophy are to be enjoyed as much as possible, as if they were ambrosia and nectar</a>.
For the pleasure arising from them is

<p>If vigor of sensation is considered by us to be an

<p class="revint"><a id="en1" href="#er1">P. 50.</a> <i>Better worth saving than ten thousand
corporeal eyes.</i></p>
<p>Iamblichus here alludes to what Plato says in
the seventh book of his Republic, respecting the
mathematical disciplines. For he there says, &ldquo;that
the soul through these disciplines has an organ
purified and enlightened, which is blinded and buried
by studies of another kind, an organ better
worth saving than ten thousand eyes, since truth
becomes visible through this alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="revint"><a id="en2" href="#er2">P. 58.</a> <i>That in which the Sirens subsist.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;The divine Plato, (says Proclus in his MS.
Scholia on the Cratylus,) knew that there are
three kinds of Sirens; the <i>celestial</i>, which is under
<span class="pb" id="Page_284">284</span>
the government of Jupiter; <i>that which produces
generation</i>, and is under the government of Neptune;
and <i>that which is cathartic</i>, and is under the
government of Pluto. It is common to all these
to incline all things through an harmonic motion
to their ruling Gods. Hence, when the soul is in
the heavens, the Sirens are desirous of uniting it to
the divine life which florishes there. But it is
proper that souls living in generation should sail
beyond them, like the Homeric Ulysses, that they
may not be allured by generation, of which the sea
is an image. And when souls are in Hades, the
Sirens are desirous of uniting them through intellectual
conceptions to Pluto. So that Plato knew
that in the kingdom of Hades there are Gods, d&aelig;mons,
and souls, who dance as it were round
Pluto, allured by the Sirens that dwell there.&rdquo; See
more concerning the Sirens in my translation of
Proclus on the Theology of Plato, Book the 6th.</p>
<p class="revint"><a id="en3" href="#er3">P. 60.</a> <i>That it is requisite to put the shoe on
the right foot first.</i></p>
<p>This audition is taken from what forms the 12th
Symbol in the Protreptics of Iamblichus, and is as
follows: &ldquo;When stretching forth your feet to have
your sandals put on, first extend your right foot;
but when about to use a foot bath, first extend your
<span class="pb" id="Page_285">285</span>
left foot.&rdquo; &ldquo;This Symbol, (says Iamblichus,) exhorts
to practical prudence, admonishing us to place worthy
actions about us as right-handed; but entirely
to lay aside and throw away such as are base, as
being left-handed.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="revint"><a id="en4" href="#er4">P. 60.</a> <i>That it is not proper to walk in the
public ways.</i></p>
<p>This is the 5th Symbol in the Protreptics of
Iamblichus, but is there differently expressed: for
it is, &ldquo;Declining from the public ways, walk in
unfrequented paths.&rdquo; On which Iamblichus observes:
&ldquo;I think that this Symbol also contributes
to the same thing as the preceding, [which is,
&lsquo;Disbelieve, nothing wonderful concerning the
Gods, nor concerning divine dogmas&rsquo;]. For this
exhorts us to abandon a popular and merely human
life; but thinks fit that we should pursue a
separate and divine life. It also signifies that it is
necessary to look above common opinions; but
very much to esteem such as are private and arcane;
and that we should despise merely human delight;
but ardently pursue that felicitous mode of conduct
which adheres to the divine will. It likewise exhorts
us to dismiss human manners as popular, and
to exchange for these the religious cultivation of
the Gods, as transcending a popular life.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_286">286</div>
<p class="revint"><a id="en5" href="#er5">P. 61.</a> <i>Do not assist a man in laying a burden
down.</i></p>
<p>This in the Protreptics is the 11th Symbol, and
is explained by Iamblichus as follows: &ldquo;This
Symbol exhorts to fortitude; for whoever takes
up a burden, signifies that he undertakes an
action of labor and energy; but he who lays one
down, of rest and remission. So that the Symbol
has the following meaning; Do not become either
to yourself or another the cause of an indolent and
effeminate mode of conduct; for every useful thing
is acquired by labor. But the Pythagoreans celebrate
this Symbol as Herculean, thus denominating
it from the labors of Hercules. For during his
association with men, he frequently returned from
fire and every thing dreadful, indignantly rejecting
indolence. For rectitude of conduct is produced
from acting and operating, but not from sluggishness.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="revint"><a id="en6" href="#er6">P. 61.</a> <i>Do not draw near to a woman for the
sake of begetting children, if she has gold.</i></p>
<p>In the Protreptics of Iamblichus (Symbol 35.)
this is expressed as follows: &ldquo;Draw not near to
that which has gold, in order to produce children.&rdquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_287">287</span>
On which Iamblichus observes: &ldquo;The Symbol
does not here speak of a woman, but of that sect
and philosophy which has much of the corporeal
in it, and a gravitating tendency downwards. For
gold is the heaviest of all things in the earth, and
pursues a tendency to the middle, which is the peculiarity
of corporeal weight. But the term to
<i>draw near</i>, not only signifies to be connected with,
but always to approach towards, and to be seated
near another.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="revint"><a id="en7" href="#er7">P. 61.</a> <i>Speak not about Pythagoric concerns
without light.</i></p>
<p>This is the 13th Symbol in the Protreptics, and
is thus explained by Iamblichus: &ldquo;This Symbol
exhorts to the possession of intellectual prudence.
For this is similar to the light of the soul, to which
being indefinite it gives bound, and leads, as it were,
from darkness into light. It is proper, therefore, to
place intellect as the leader of every thing beautiful
in life, but especially in Pythagoric dogmas; for
these cannot be known without light.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="revint"><a id="en8" href="#er8">P. 61.</a> <i>Wear not the image of God in a ring.</i></p>
<p>This in the Protreptics is the 24th Symbol;
but instead of <i>wear</i>, it is there <i>inscribe</i>. But Iamblichus&rsquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_288">288</span>
explanation of it is as follows: &ldquo;This Symbol
conformably to the foregoing conception, employs
the following exhortation: Philosophize, and
before every thing consider the Gods as having an
incorporeal subsistence. For this is the most principal
root of the Pythagoric dogmas, from which
nearly all of them are suspended, and by which
they are strengthened even to the end. Do not
therefore think that the Gods use such forms as
are corporeal, or that they are received by a material
subject, and by body as a material bond, like
other animals. But the engravings in rings exhibit
the bond which subsists through the ring, its
corporeal nature and sensible form, and the view
as it were of some partial animal, which becomes
apparent through the engraving; from which especially
we should separate the genus of the Gods, as
being eternal and intelligible, and always subsisting
according to the same and in a similar manner, as
we have particularly, most fully, and scientifically
shown in our treatise concerning the Gods.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_97" href="#fn_97">[97]</a></p>
<p class="revint"><a id="en9" href="#er9">P. 61.</a> <i>Nor is it proper to sacrifice a white
cock; for this also is a suppliant, and is sacred
to the moon.</i></p>
<p>In the Protreptics, the 18th Symbol is partly the
same with, and partly different from this. For it
<span class="pb" id="Page_289">289</span>
is, &ldquo;Nourish a cock; but sacrifice it not; for it is
sacred to the sun and the moon.&rdquo; And Iamblichus
explains it as follows: &ldquo;This Symbol advises us to
nourish and strengthen the body and not neglect it,
dissolving and destroying the mighty tokens of the
union, connexion, sympathy, and consent of the
world. So that it exhorts us to engage in the contemplation
and philosophy of the universe. For
though the truth concerning the universe is naturally
occult, and sufficiently difficult of investigation,
it must, however, at the same time, be inquired
into and investigated by man, and especially
through philosophy. For it is truly impossible to
be discovered through any other pursuit. But philosophy
receiving certain sparks, and as it were
viatica, from nature, excites and expands them into
magnitude, rendering them more conspicuous
through the disciplines which it possesses. Hence,
therefore, we should philosophize.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="revint"><a id="en10" href="#er10">P. 61.</a> <i>It is proper to sacrifice, and to enter
temples, unshod.</i></p>
<p>This in the Protreptics is the 3rd Symbol; but
is thus enunciated by Iamblichus, &ldquo;Sacrifice and
adore unshod.&rdquo; On which Iamblichus observes:
&ldquo;This Symbol signifies that we ought to worship
the Gods, and acquire a knowledge of them in an
<span class="pb" id="Page_290">290</span>
orderly and modest manner, and in a way not surpassing
our condition on the earth. It also signifies
that, in worshipping them, and acquiring this
knowledge, we should be free from bonds, and properly
liberated. But the Symbol exhorts that sacrifice
and adoration should be performed not only
in the body, but also in the energies of the soul;
so that these energies may neither be detained by
passions, nor by the imbecility of the body, nor by
generation, with which we are externally surrounded.
But every thing pertaining to us should
be properly liberated, and prepared, for the participation
of the Gods.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="revint"><a id="en11" href="#er11">P. 77.</a> <i>Enter not into a temple negligently, nor,
in short, adore carelessly, not even though you
should stand at the very doors themselves.</i></p>
<p>This in the Protreptics is the 2nd Symbol, and is
explained by Iamblichus as follows: &ldquo;If the similar
is friendly and allied to the similar, it is evident
that since the Gods have a most principal essence
among wholes, we ought to make the worship of
them a principal object. But he who does this for
the sake of any thing else, gives a secondary rank
to that which takes the precedency of all things, and
subverts the whole order of religious worship and
knowledge. Besides, it is not proper to rank illustrious
<span class="pb" id="Page_291">291</span>
goods in the subordinate condition of human
utility, nor to place our concerns in the order of an
end, but things more excellent, whether they be
works or conceptions, in the condition of an appendage.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="revint"><a id="en12" href="#er12">P. 79.</a> <i>These, therefore, he ordered not to eat
the heart.</i></p>
<p>This is the 30th Symbol in the Protreptics, and
is thus explained by Iamblichus: &ldquo;This Symbol
signifies that it is not proper to divulse the union
and consent of the universe. And still further, it
signifies this, Be not envious, but philanthropic,
and communicative: and from this it exhorts us to
philosophize. For philosophy alone among the
sciences and arts, is neither pained with the goods
of others, nor rejoices in the evils of neighbours,
these being allied and familiar by nature, subject
to the like passions, and exposed to one common
fortune. It likewise evinces that the future is
equally unlooked for by all men. Hence, it exhorts
us to sympathy and mutual love, and to be
truly communicative, as it becomes rational animals.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_292">292</div>
<p class="revint"><a id="en13" href="#er13">P. 79.</a> <i>Nor the brain.</i></p>
<p>This is the 31st Symbol in the Protreptics, and
which Iamblichus thus explains: &ldquo;This Symbol
also resembles the former: for the brain is the
ruling instrument of intellectual prudence. The
Symbol, therefore, obscurely signifies that we ought
not to dilacerate nor mangle things and dogmas,
which have been the objects of judicious deliberation.
But these will be such as have been the
subject of intellectual consideration, becoming thus
equal to objects of a scientific nature. For things
of this kind are to be surveyed, not through the
instruments of the irrational form of the soul, such
as the heart and the liver; but through the pure
rational nature. Hence, to dilacerate these by opposition,
is inconsiderate folly; but the Symbol
rather exhorts us to venerate the fountain of intelligence,
and the most proximate organ of intellectual
perception, through which we shall possess
contemplation, science, and wisdom; and by which
we shall truly philosophize, and neither confound
nor obscure the vestiges which philosophy produces.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_293">293</div>
<p class="revint"><a id="en14" href="#er14">P. 79.</a> <i>To abstain from mallows, &amp;c.</i></p>
<p>The 38th Symbol in the Protreptics is: &ldquo;Transplant
mallows in your garden, but eat them not.&rdquo;
On which Iamblichus observes as follows: &ldquo;This
Symbol obscurely signifies that plants of this kind
turn with the sun, and it thinks fit that this should
be noticed by us. It also adds, <i>transplant</i>, that is
to say, observe its nature, its tendency towards,
and sympathy with, the sun; but rest not satisfied,
nor dwelt upon this, but transfer, and as it were
transplant your conception to kindred plants and
pot-herbs, and also to animals which are not kindred,
to stones and rivers, and, in short, to natures
of every kind. For you will find them to be prolific
and multiform, and admirably abundant; and
this to one who begins from the mallows, as from
a root and principle, is significant of the union and
consent of the world. Not only, therefore, do not
destroy or obliterate observations of this kind; but
increase and multiply them as if they were transplanted.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_294">294</div>
<p class="revint"><a id="en15" href="#er15">P. 80.</a> <i>Thus too he ordered them to abstain
from the fish Melanurus.</i><a class="fn" id="fr_98" href="#fn_98">[98]</a></p>
<p>The 6th Symbol in the Protreptics is, &ldquo;Abstain
from melanurus; for it belongs to the terrestrial
Gods.&rdquo; And this, according to Iamblichus, admonishes
us to embrace the celestial journey, to conjoin
ourselves to the intellectual Gods, to become
separated from a material nature, and to be led as
it were in a circular profession to an immaterial
and pure life. It further exhorts us to adopt the
most excellent worship of the Gods, and especially
that which pertains to the primary<a class="fn" id="fr_99" href="#fn_99">[99]</a> Gods.</p>
<p class="revint"><a id="en16" href="#er16">P. 80.</a> <i>And also not to receive the fish Erythynus.</i></p>
<p>This in the Protreptics is the 33rd Symbol, and
which Iamblichus thus explains: &ldquo;This Symbol
seems to be merely referred to the etymology of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_295">295</span>
name. Receive not an unblushing and impudent
man; nor on the contrary one stupidly astonished,
and who in every thing blushes, and is humble in
the extreme, through the imbecility of his intellect
and reasoning power. Hence this also is understood,
Be not yourself such a one.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="revint"><a id="en17" href="#er17">P. 80.</a> <i>He likewise exhorted them to abstain
from beans.</i></p>
<p>In the Protreptics this is the 37th Symbol; and
Iamblichus has not developed for us the more mystical
signification of this symbol. For he only says
that &ldquo;it admonishes us to beware of every thing
which is corruptive of our converse with the Gods
and divine prophecy.&rdquo; But Aristotle appears to
have assigned the true mystical reason why the
Pythagoreans abstained from beans. For he says,
(apud Laert.) &ldquo;that Pythagoras considered beans
as a symbol of generation [i.&nbsp;e. of the whole of a
visible and corporeal nature,] which subsists according
to a right line, and is without inflection; because
a bean alone of almost all spermatic plants,
is perforated through the whole of it, and is not
obstructed by any intervening joints.&rdquo; Hence he
adds, &ldquo;it resembles the gates of Hades.&rdquo; For these
are perpetually open without any impediment to
souls descending into generation. The exhortation,
<span class="pb" id="Page_296">296</span>
therefore, to abstain from beans, is equivalent to
admonishing us to beware of a continued and perpetual
descent into the realms of generation.
Hence the true meaning of the following celebrated
lines in Virgil;</p>
<div class="verse">

<p class="revint"><a id="en18" href="#er18">P. 98.</a> <i>Such as infallible predictions of earthquakes,
rapid expulsions of pestilence, &amp;c. &amp;c.</i></p>
<p>Since Pythagoras, as Iamblichus informs us,
<a href="#Page_9">p. 9</a>. was initiated in all the mysteries of Byblus
and Tyre, in the sacred operations of the Syrians,
and in the mysteries of the Ph&oelig;nicians, and also
(<a href="#Page_12">p. 12</a>.) that he spent two and twenty years in the
adyta of temples in Egypt, associated with the
Magi in Babylon, and was instructed by them in
their venerable knowledge;&mdash;it is not at all wonderful
<span class="pb" id="Page_297">297</span>
that he was skilled in magic or theurgy, and
was therefore able to perform things which surpass
<i>merely human power</i>, and which appear to be perfectly
incredible to the vulgar. For &ldquo;magic,&rdquo; (as
we learn from Psellus in his MS. treatise on D&aelig;mons)
&ldquo;formed the last part of the sacerdotal
science.&rdquo; He farther likewise informs us, &ldquo;that
magic investigates the nature, power, and quality
of every thing sublunary; viz. of the elements and
their parts, of animals, all-various plants, and their
fruits, of stones, and herbs: and in short, it explores
the essence and power of every thing. From
hence, therefore, it produces its effects. And it
forms statues which procure health, makes all-various
figures, and things which become the instruments
of disease. If asserts too, that eagles and
dragons contribute to health; but that cats, dogs,
and crows, are symbols of vigilance, to which therefore
they contribute. But for the fashioning of
certain parts, wax and clay are used. Often, too,
celestial fire is made to appear through magic; and
then statues laugh, and lamps are spontaneously
enkindled.&rdquo; See the original in the Notes to my
Pausanias, p. 325. And that theurgy was employed
by the ancients in their mysteries, I have
fully proved in my treatise On the Eleusinian and
Bacchic Mysteries.<a class="fn" id="fr_100" href="#fn_100">[100]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_298">298</div>
<p>Conformably to this, Plato also in the First Alcibiades
says, that the magic of Zoroaster consisted
in the worship of the Gods, on which passage, I
shall present the reader with what I have said, in
the first volume of my Plato, p. 63, as it will enable
him to see that the theurgy of the ancients is
founded in a theory equally scientific and sublime.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The following account of magic by Proclus,
originally formed, as it appears to me, a part of the
Commentary written by him on the present passage.
For the MS. Commentary of Proclus,
which is extant on this dialogue, does not extend to
more than a third part of it; and this Dissertation
on Magic, which is only extant in Latin, was published
by Ficinus the translator, immediately after
his Excerpta from this Commentary. So that it
seems highly probable, that the manuscript from
which Ficinus translated his Excerpta, was much
more perfect, than that which has been preserved
to us, in consequence of containing this account of
the magic of the ancients.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the same manner as lovers gradually advance
from that beauty which is apparent in sensible
forms, to that which is divine; so the ancient
priests, when they considered that there is a certain
alliance and sympathy in natural things to each
other, and of things manifest to occult powers, and
discovered that all things subsist in all, they fabricated
a sacred science from this mutual sympathy
<span class="pb" id="Page_299">299</span>
and similarity. Thus they recognized things supreme
in such as are subordinate, and the subordinate
in the supreme: in the celestial regions,
terrene properties subsisting in a causal and celestial
manner; and in earth celestial properties, but
according to a terrene condition. For how shall
we account for those plants called heliotropes, that
is, attendants on the sun, moving in correspondence
with the revolution of its orb, but selenitropes, or
attendants on the moon, turning in exact conformity
to her motion? It is because all things
pray, and hymn the leaders of their respective orders;
but some intellectually, and others rationally;
some in a natural, and others after a sensible manner.
Hence the sun-flower, as far as it is able,
moves in a circular dance towards the sun; so that
if any one could hear the pulsation made by its
circuit in the air, he would perceive something composed
by a sound of this kind, in honor of its king,
such as a plant is capable of framing. Hence, too,
we may behold the sun and moon in the earth, but
according to a terrene quality; but in the celestial
regions, all plants, and stones, and animals, possessing
an intellectual life according to a celestial
nature. Now the ancients, having contemplated
this mutual sympathy of things, applied for occult
purposes, both celestial and terrene natures, by
means of which, through a certain similitude, they
deduced divine virtues into this inferior abode.
<span class="pb" id="Page_300">300</span>
For, indeed, similitude itself is a sufficient cause of
binding things together in union and consent. Thus,
if a piece of paper is heated, and afterwards placed
near a lamp, though it does not touch the fire, the
paper will be suddenly inflamed, and the flame will
descend from the superior to the inferior parts.
This heated paper we may compare, to a certain
relation of inferiors to superiors; and its approximation
to the lamp, to the opportune use of things
according to time, place, and matter. But the
procession of fire into the paper, aptly represents
the presence of divine light, to that nature which is
capable of its reception. Lastly, the inflammation
of the paper may be compared to the deification
of mortals, and to the illumination of material natures,
which are afterwards carried upwards like the
enkindled paper, from a certain participation of
divine seed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Again, the lotus, before the rising of the sun,
folds its leaves into itself, but gradually expands
them on its rising: unfolding them in proportion
to the sun&rsquo;s ascent to the zenith; but as gradually
contracting them, as that luminary descends to the
west. Hence this plant, by the expansion and
contraction of its leaves, appears no less to honor
the sun, than men by the gesture of their eye-lids,
and the motion of their lips. But this imitation
and certain participation of supernal light, is not
only visible in plants, which possess nothing more
<span class="pb" id="Page_301">301</span>
than a vestige of life, but likewise in particular
stones. Thus the sun-stone, by its golden rays, imitates
those of the sun; but the stone called the eye
of heaven, or of the sun, has a figure similar to the
pupil of an eye, and a ray shines from the middle
of the pupil. Thus too the lunar stone, which has
a figure similar to the moon when horned, by a
certain change of itself, follows the lunar motion.
Lastly, the stone called helioselenus, i.&nbsp;e. of the
sun and moon, imitates, after a manner, the congress
of those luminaries, which it images by its
color. So that all things are full of divine natures;
terrestrial natures receiving the plenitude of such as
are celestial, but celestial of supercelestial essences;<a class="fn" id="fr_101" href="#fn_101">[101]</a>
while every order of things proceeds gradually
in a beautiful descent from the highest to
the lowest. For whatever particulars are collected
into one above the order of things, are afterwards
dilated in descending, various souls being distributed
under their various ruling divinities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the next place, there are many solar animals,
such as lions and cocks, which participate,
according to their nature, of a certain solar divinity;
whence it is wonderful how much inferiors
yield to superiors in the same order, though they
do not yield in magnitude and power. Hence it
is said, that a cock is very much feared, and as it
<span class="pb" id="Page_302">302</span>
were reverenced, by a lion; the reason of which
we cannot assign from matter or sense, but from
the contemplation alone of a supernal order. For
thus we shall find that the presence of the solar
virtue accords more with a cock than with a lion.
This will be evident from considering that the
cock, as it were, with certain hymns, applauds and
calls to the rising sun, when he bends his course to
us from the antipodes; and that solar angels sometimes
appear in forms of this kind, who though they
are without shape, yet present themselves to us
who are connected with shape, in some sensible
form. Sometimes too there are d&aelig;mons with a
leonine front, who, when a cock is placed before
them, unless they are of a solar order, suddenly
disappear; and this, because those natures which
have an inferior rank in the same order, always
reverence their superiors; just as many, on beholding
the images of divine men, are accustomed,
from the very view, to be fearful of perpetrating
any thing base.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In fine, some things turn round correspondent
to the revolutions of the sun, as the plants which
we have mentioned, and others after a manner imitate
the solar rays, as the palm and the date; some
the fiery nature of the sun, as the laurel; and
others a different property. For, indeed, we may
perceive that the properties which are collected in
the sun, are every where distributed to subsequent
<span class="pb" id="Page_303">303</span>
natures constituted in a solar order; that is,
to angels, d&aelig;mons, souls, animals, plants, and
stones. Hence the authors of the ancient priesthood
discovered from things apparent, the worship
of superior powers, while they mingled some things
and purified others. They mingled many things
indeed together, because they saw that some simple
substances possessed a divine property (though not
taken singly) sufficient to call down that particular
power, of which they were participants. Hence,
by the mingling of many things together, they attracted
upon us a supernal influx; and by the
composition of one thing from many, they produced
an assimilation to that one which is above
many; and composed statues from the mixture of
various substances conspiring in sympathy and consent.
Besides this, they collected composite
odours, by a divine art, into one, comprehending
a multitude of powers, and symbolizing with the
unity of a divine essence; considering that division
debilitates each of these, but that mingling them
together, restores them to the idea of their exemplar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But sometimes one herb, or one stone, is sufficient
to a divine operation. Thus, a thistle is
sufficient to procure the sudden appearance of some
superior power; but a laurel, raccinum, (or a
thorny kind of sprig) the land and sea onion, the
coral, the diamond, and the jasper, operate as a
<span class="pb" id="Page_304">304</span>
safeguard. The heart of a mole is subservient to
divination, but sulphur and marine water to purification.
Hence, the ancient priests, by the mutual
relation and sympathy of things to each other, collected
their virtues into one, but expelled them by
repugnancy and antipathy; purifying when it was
requisite with sulphur and bitumen, and sprinkling
with marine water. For sulphur purifies, from
the sharpness of its odour; but marine water, on
account of its fiery portion. Besides this, in the
worship of the Gods, they offered animals, and
other substances congruous to their nature; and
received, in the first place, the powers of d&aelig;mons,
as proximate to natural substances and operations;
and by these natural substances they convoked into
their presence those powers to which they approached.
Afterwards, they proceeded from d&aelig;mons
to the powers and energies of the Gods;
partly, indeed, from d&aelig;moniacal instruction, but
partly by their own industry, interpreting convenient
symbols, and ascending to a proper intelligence
of the Gods. And lastly, laying aside natural
substances and their operations, they received
themselves into the communion and fellowship
of the Gods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It will doubtless be objected by most of the present
period, who believe in nothing beyond the information
of their senses, that plants, animals, and
stones, no longer possess those wonderful sympathetic
<span class="pb" id="Page_305">305</span>
powers, which are mentioned by Proclus in
the above extract. In answer to any such objector,
whose <i>little</i> soul, (in the language of the Emperor
Julian) is indeed acute, but sees nothing with
a vision healthy and sound, it must be said, that
this is not at all wonderful at a period, when, as
the author of the Asclepian dialogue justly observes,
&ldquo;there is a lamentable departure of divinity from
man, when nothing worthy of heaven, or celestial
concerns, is heard or believed, and when every divine
voice is by a <i>necessary</i> silence dumb.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_102" href="#fn_102">[102]</a> But
to the philosophic reader, it must be observed, that
as in the realms of generation, or in other words,
the sublunary region, wholes, viz. the spheres of the
different elements, remain perpetually according to
nature; but their parts are sometimes according,
and sometimes contrary to nature; this must also
be true of the parts of the earth. When those circulations
therefore take place, during which the parts
of the earth subsist according to nature, and which
are justly called, by Plato, fertile periods, the powers
of plants, animals, and stones, magically sympathize
with superior natures, in consequence of a
more abundant participation of them, through a
greater degree of aptitude to receive, and alliance
<span class="pb" id="Page_306">306</span>
to the participated powers. But during those circulations,
in which the parts of the earth subsist
contrary to nature, as at present, and which Plato
calls barren periods, the powers of plants, animals,
and stones, no longer possess a magic sympathy,
and consequently are no longer capable of producing
magical operations.</p>
<p class="revint"><a id="en19" href="#er19">P. 106.</a> <i>The eternal essence of number is the
most providential principle of the universe</i>, &amp;c.</p>
<p>The following account of the manner in which
the Pythagoreans philosophized about numbers, is
extracted from my Theoretic Arithmetic, and the
information contained in it is principally derived
from the great Syrianus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Pythagoreans, turning from the vulgar
paths, and delivering their philosophy in secret to
those alone who were worthy to receive it, exhibited
it to others through mathematical names. Hence,
they called forms, numbers, as things which are the
first separated from impartible union; for the natures
which are above forms, are also above separation.<a class="fn" id="fr_103" href="#fn_103">[103]</a>
The all-perfect multitude of forms, therefore,
<span class="pb" id="Page_307">307</span>
they obscurely signified through the duad;
but they indicated the first formal principles by
the monad and duad, as not being numbers;
and also by the first triad and tetrad, as being the
first numbers, the one being odd, and the other
even, from which by addition the decad is generated;
for the sum of 1, 2, 3, and 4, is ten. But
after numbers, in secondary and multifarious lives,
introducing geometrical prior to physical magnitudes;
these also they referred to numbers, as to
formal causes and the principles of these; referring
the point indeed, as being impartible, to the monad;
but a line, as the first interval, to the duad; and
again, a superficies, as having a more abundant interval,
to the triad; and a solid to the tetrad. They
also called, as is evident from the testimony of
Aristotle, the first length the duad; for it is not
simply length, but the <i>first</i> length, in order that by
this they might signify <i>cause</i>. In a similar manner
also, they denominated the <i>first</i> breadth, the triad;
and the <i>first</i> depth the tetrad. They also referred
to formal principles all psychical knowledge. And
intellectual knowledge indeed, as being contracted
according to impartible union, they referred to the
monad; but scientific knowledge, as being evolved,
and as proceeding from cause to the thing caused,
yet through the inerratic, and always through the
same things, they referred to the duad; and opinion
to the triad, because the power of it is not
<span class="pb" id="Page_308">308</span>
always directed to the same thing, but at one time
inclines to the true, and at another to the false.
And they referred sense to the tetrad, because it
has an apprehension of bodies; for in the duad, indeed,
there is one interval from one monad to the
other; but in the triad there are two intervals
from any one monad to the rest; and in the tetrad
there are three. They referred, therefore, to
principles every thing knowable, viz. beings, and
the gnostic powers of these. But they divided
beings not according to breadth, but according
to depth; into intelligibles, objects of science,
objects of opinion, and sensibles. In a similar
manner, also, they divided knowledge into intellect,
science, opinion, and sense. The extremity,
therefore, of the intelligible triad, or animal
itself, as it is called by Plato in the Tim&aelig;us, is
assumed from the division of the objects of knowledge,
manifesting the intelligible order, in which
forms themselves, viz. the first forms and the principles
of these, are contained, viz. the idea of the
one itself, of the first length, which is the duad itself,
and also the ideas of the first breadth and the
first depth; (for in common the term <i>first</i> is
adapted to all of them), viz. to the triad itself, and
the tetrad itself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Again, the Pythagoreans and Plato did
not denominate idea from one thing, and ideal
number from another. But since the assertion
<span class="pb" id="Page_309">309</span>
is eminently true, that all things are similar
to number, it is evident that number, and
especially every ideal number, was denominated
on account of its paradigmatic peculiarity. If
any one, however, wishes to apprehend this
from the appellation itself, it is easy to infer
that idea was so called, from rendering as it were
its participants similar to itself, and imparting
to them <i>form</i>, <i>order</i>, <i>beauty</i>, and <i>unity</i>; and this
in consequence of always preserving the same form,
expanding its own power to the infinity of particulars,
and investing with the same species its eternal
participants. <i>Number</i> also, since it imparts proportion
and elegant arrangement to all things, was
allotted this appellation. For the ancients, says
Syrianus,<a class="fn" id="fr_104" href="#fn_104">[104]</a> call to <i>adapt</i> or <i>compose</i><span title="arsai" class="g"> &alpha;&rho;&sigma;&alpha;&iota;</span> <i>arsai</i>,
whence is derived <span title="arithmos" class="g">&alpha;&rho;&iota;&theta;&mu;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span> <i>arithmos number</i>.
Hence <span title="anarsion" class="g"> &alpha;&nu;&alpha;&rho;&sigma;&iota;&omicron;&nu;</span> anarsion among the Greeks signifies <i>incomposite</i>.
Hence too, those Grecian sayings, <i>you
will adapt the balance</i>, <i>they placed number together
with them</i>, and also <i>number and friendship</i>. From
all which number was called by the Greeks <i>arithmos</i>,
as that which measures and orderly arranges
all things, and unites them in amicable league.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Farther still, some of the Pythagoreans discoursed
about inseparable numbers alone, i.&nbsp;e.
numbers which are inseparable from mundane natures,
<span class="pb" id="Page_310">310</span>
but others about such as have a subsistence
separate from the universe, in which as paradigms
they saw those numbers are contained, which are
perfected by nature. But others, making a distinction
between the two, unfolded their doctrine in
a more clear and perfect manner. If it be requisite,
however, to speak concerning the difference of
these monads, and their privation of difference, we
must say that the monads which subsist in quantity,
are by no means to be extended to essential numbers;
but when we call essential numbers monads,
we must assert that all of them mutually differ
from each other by <i>difference</i> itself, and that they
possess a privation of difference from <i>sameness</i>. It
is evident also, that those which are in the same
order, are contained through mutual comparison,
in <i>sameness</i> rather than in difference, but that those
which are in different orders are conversant with
much diversity, through the dominion of <i>difference</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Again, the Pythagoreans asserted that nature
produces sensibles by numbers; but then these
numbers were not mathematical but physical; and
as they spoke symbolically, it is not improbable
that they demonstrated every property of sensibles
by mathematical names. However, says Syrianus,
to ascribe to them a knowledge of sensible numbers
alone, is not only ridiculous, but highly impious.
For they received indeed, from the theology
of Orpheus, the principles of intelligible and
<span class="pb" id="Page_311">311</span>
intellectual numbers, they assigned them an abundant
progression, and extended their dominion as
far as to sensibles themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again, their conceptions about mathematical
and physical number, were as follow:</p>
<p>&ldquo;As in every thing, according to the doctrine of
Aristotle, one thing corresponds to matter, and
another to form, in any number, as for instance the
pentad, its five monads, and in short its quantity,
and the number which is the subject of participation,
are derived from the duad itself; but its form,
i.&nbsp;e. the pentad itself, is from the monad; for every
form is a monad, and unites its subject quantity.
The pentad itself, therefore, which is a monad,
proceeds from the principal monad, forms its subject
quantity, which is itself formless, and connects
it to its own form. For there are two principles of
mathematical numbers in our souls: the monad,
which comprehends in itself all the forms of numbers,
and corresponds to the monad in intellectual
natures; and the duad, which is a certain generative
principle of infinite power, and which on this
account, as being the image of the never-failing and
intelligible duad, is called indefinite. While this
proceeds to all things, it is not deserted in its
course by the monad, but that which proceeds from
the monad continually distinguishes and forms
boundless quantity, gives a specific distinction to
all its orderly progressions, and incessantly adorns
them with forms. And as in mundane natures,
<span class="pb" id="Page_312">312</span>
there is neither any thing formless, nor any vacuum
among the species of things, so likewise in mathematical
number, neither is any quantity left innumerable;
for thus the forming power of the monad
would be vanquished by the indefinite duad, nor
does any medium intervene between the consequent
numbers, and the well-disposed energy of
the monad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither, therefore, does the pentad consist of
substance and accident, as a white man; nor of
genus and difference, as man of animal and biped;
nor of five monads mutually touching each other,
like a bundle of wood; nor of things mingled, like
a drink made from wine and honey; nor of things
sustaining position, as stones by their position
complete the house; nor lastly, as things numerable,
for these are nothing else than particulars.
But it does not follow that numbers themselves,
because they consist of indivisible monads,
have nothing else besides monads, (for the multitude
of points in continued quantity is an indivisible
multitude, yet it is not on this account that there is
a completion of something else from the points
themselves); but this takes place because there is
something in them which corresponds to matter,
and something which corresponds to form. Lastly,
when we unite the triad with the tetrad, we say
that we make seven. The assertion, however, is
not true: for monads conjoined with monads, produce
indeed the subject of the number 7, but nothing
<span class="pb" id="Page_313">313</span>
more. Who then imparts the heptadic
form to these monads? Who is it also that gives
the form of a bed to a certain number of pieces of
wood? Shall we not say that the soul of the carpenter,
from the art which he possesses, fashions
the wood, so as to receive the form of a bed, and
that the numerative soul, from possessing in herself
a monad which has the relation of a principle, gives
form and subsistence to all numbers? But in this
only consists the difference, that the carpenter&rsquo;s art
is not naturally inherent in us, and requires manual
operation, because it is conversant with sensible
matter; but the numerative art is naturally present
with us, and is therefore possessed by all men, and
has an intellectual matter which it instantaneously
invests with form. And this is that which deceives
the multitude, who think that the heptad is nothing
besides seven monads. For the imagination of the
vulgar, unless it first sees a thing unadorned, afterwards
the supervening energy of the adorner, and
lastly, above all the thing itself, perfect and formed,
cannot be persuaded that it has two natures, one
formless, the other formal, and still further, that
which beyond these imparts form; but asserts, that
the subject is one, and without generation. Hence,
perhaps, the ancient theologists and Plato ascribed
temporal generations to things without generation,
and to things which are perpetually adorned, and
regularly disposed, privation of order and ornament,
<span class="pb" id="Page_314">314</span>
the erroneous and the boundless, that they
might lead men to the knowledge of a formal and
effective cause. It is, therefore, by no means wonderful,
that though seven sensible monads are never
without the heptad, these should be distinguished
by science, and that the former should have
the relation of a subject, and be analogous to matter,
but the latter should correspond to species and
form.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Again, as when water is changed into air, the
water does not become air, or the subject of air,
but that which was the subject of water becomes
the subject of air, so when one number unites itself
with another, as for instance the triad with the
duad, the species or forms of the two numbers are
not mingled, except in their immaterial reasons (or
productive principles), in which at the same time
that they are separate, they are not impeded from
being united, but the quantities of the two numbers
which are placed together, become the subject of
the pentad. The triad, therefore, is one, and also
the tetrad, even in mathematical numbers: for
though in the ennead or number nine, you may conceive
a first, second, and third triad, yet you see
one thing thrice assumed; and in short, in the ennead
there is nothing but the form of the ennead
in the quantity of nine monads. But if you mentally
separate its subject, (for form is impartible)
you will immediately invest it with forms corresponding
<span class="pb" id="Page_315">315</span>
to its division; for our soul cannot endure
to see that which is formless, unadorned, especially
as she possesses the power of investing it
with ornament.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since also separate numbers possess a demiurgic
or fabricative power, which mathematical numbers
imitate, the sensible world likewise contains images
of those numbers by which it is adorned; so that
all things are in all, but in an appropriate manner
in each. The sensible world, therefore, subsists
from immaterial and energetic reasons, and from
more ancient causes. But those who do not admit
that nature herself is full of productive powers,
lest they should be obliged to double things themselves,
these wonder how from things void of magnitude
and gravity, magnitude and gravity are composed;
though they are never composed from
things of this kind which are void of gravity and
magnitude, as from parts. But magnitude is generated
from essentially impartible elements; since
form and matter are the elements of bodies; and
still much more is it generated from those truer
causes which are considered in demiurgic reasons
and forms. Is it not therefore necessary that all
dimensions, and all moving masses, must from these
receive their generation? For either bodies are unbegotten,
like incorporeal natures; or of things with
interval, things without interval are the causes; of
partibles impartibles; and of sensibles and contraries,
<span class="pb" id="Page_316">316</span>
things insensible and void of contact: and we
must assent to those who assert that things possessing
magnitude are thus generated from impartibles.
Hence the Pythagorean Eurytus, and his
followers, beholding the images of things themselves
in numbers, rightly attributed certain numbers
to certain things, according to their peculiarity.
In consequence of this, he said that a particular
number is the boundary of this plant, and again,
another number of this animal; just as of a triangle
6 is the boundary, of a square 9, and of a
cube 8. As the musician, too, harmonizes his lyre
through mathematical numbers, so nature through
her own natural numbers, orderly arranges, and
modulates her productions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, that numbers are participated by the
heavens, and that there is a solar number, and
also a lunar number, is manifest according to the
adage, even to the blind. For the restitutions of
the heavenly bodies to their pristine state (<span title="apokatastaseis" class="g">&alpha;&pi;&omicron;&kappa;&alpha;&tau;&alpha;&sigma;&tau;&alpha;&sigma;&epsilon;&iota;&sigmaf;</span>)
would not always be effected through
the same things, and in the same manner, unless
one and the same number bad dominion in each.
Yet all these contribute to the procession of the celestial
spheres, and are contained by their perfect
number. But there is also a certain natural number
belonging to every animal. For things of the
same species would not be distinguished by organs
after the same manner, nor would they arrive at
<span class="pb" id="Page_317">317</span>
puberty and old age about the same time, or generate,
nor would the f&oelig;tus be nourished or increase,
according to regular periods, unless they were detained
by the same measure of nature. According
to the best of the Pythagoreans also, Plato himself,
number is the cause of better and worse generations.
Hence though the Pythagoreans sometimes
speak of the squares and cubes of natural numbers,
they do not make them to be monadic, such as the
number 9, and the number 27; but they signify
through these names, from similitude, the progression
of natural numbers into, and dominion about,
generations. In like manner, though they call
them equal or double, they exhibit the dominion
and symphony of ideas in these numbers. Hence
different things do not use the same number, so
far as they are different, nor do the same things use
a different number, so far as they are the same.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In short, physical numbers are material forms
divided about the subject which receives them.
But material powers are the sources of connexion
and modification to bodies. For form is one
thing, and the power proceeding from it another.
For form itself is indeed impartible and essential;
but being extended, and becoming bulky, it emits
from itself, as if it were a blast, material powers
which are certain qualities. Thus, for instance, in
fire, the form and essence of it is impartible, and is
truly the image of the cause of fire: for in partible
<span class="pb" id="Page_318">318</span>
natures, the impartible has a subsistence. But
from form which is impartible in fire, and which
subsists in it as number, an extension of it accompanied
with interval takes place about matter,
from which the powers of fire are emitted, such as
heat, or refrigeration, or moisture, or something
else of the like kind. And these qualities are indeed
essential, but are by no means the essence
of fire. For essences do not proceed from qualities,
nor are essence and power the same thing.
But the essential every where precedes power.
And from this being one the multitude of powers
proceeds, and the distributed from that which is
undistributed; just as many energies are the progeny
of one power.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="revint"><a id="en20" href="#er20">P. 107.</a> <i>For Pythagoras always proclaimed, that
nothing admirable pertaining to the Gods or
divine dogmas, should be disbelieved.</i></p>
<p>This in the Protreptics forms the fourth symbol,
and is thus explained by Iamblichus:&mdash;&ldquo;This dogma
sufficiently venerates and unfolds the transcendency
of the Gods, affording us a viaticum, and recalling
to our memory that we ought not to estimate divine
power from our judgment. But it is likely that
some things should appear difficult and impossible
to us, in consequence of our corporeal subsistence,
<span class="pb" id="Page_319">319</span>
and from our being conversant with generation and
corruption; from our having a momentary existence;
from being subject to a variety of diseases;
from the smallness of our habitation; from our
gravitating tendency to the middle; from our somnolency,
indigence and repletion; from our want of
counsel and our imbecility; from the impediments
of our soul, and a variety of other circumstances,
although our nature possesses many illustrious prerogatives.
At the same time however we perfectly
fall short of the Gods, and neither possess the same
power with them, nor equal virtue. This symbol
therefore in a particular manner introduces the
knowledge of the Gods, as beings who are able to
effect all things. On this account it exhorts us to
disbelieve nothing concerning the Gods. It also
adds, nor about divine dogmas; viz. those belonging
to the Pythagoric philosophy. For these being
secured by disciplines and scientific theory, are
alone true and free from falsehood, being corroborated
by all-various demonstration, accompanied
with necessity. The same symbol, also, is capable
of exhorting us to the science concerning the Gods:
for it urges us to acquire a science of that kind,
through which we shall be in no respect deficient
in things asserted about the Gods. It is also able
to exhort the same things concerning divine dogmas,
and a disciplinative progression. For disciplines
alone give eyes to, and produce light about, all
<span class="pb" id="Page_320">320</span>
things, in him who intends to consider and survey
them. For from the participation of disciplines,
one thing before all others is effected, viz. a belief
in the nature, essence, and power of the Gods, and
also in those Pythagoric dogmas, which appear to
be prodigious to such as have not been introduced
to, and are uninitiated in, disciplines; So that the
precept <i>disbelieve not</i> is equivalent to <i>participate</i>
and <i>acquire</i> those things through which you will
not disbelieve; that is to say, acquire disciplines and
scientific demonstrations.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="revint"><a id="enx" href="#erx">P. 88.</a> <i>After this manner therefore it is said
that music was discovered by Pythagoras.</i></p>
<p>The following particulars relative to music are

placed upon some oblong and polished rule. The

The tactus, therefore, being placed under E, press
there the chord, so that one half of it only, as for
instance ED, may be wholly struck and resound.
Having therefore struck each of the chords at the
same time, viz. the whole of AB, and the half ED,
so that they may resound at one and the same time,
you will hear the sweetest of all consonances, composed
from the sound of the whole chord AB, and
the sound of the half ED. This consonance the
ancients called diapason, i.&nbsp;e. <i>through all</i> [the
chords], because in the musical instruments of the
ancients, the two extreme chords, i.&nbsp;e. the most
grave, and the most acute of all the chords, contained
this consonance; so that, from the gravest
chord having made a transition through all the
chords to the supreme and most acute of all, they
would hear this sweetest consonance. It was, likewise,
said to be in a duple ratio of the proportion
<span class="pb" id="Page_322">322</span>
of one sound to the other. For the sound of the
chord AB is doubly greater or more grave than the
sound of the half ED. For as sounding bodies are
to each other, so are their sounds. But the chord
AB is the double of ED. This, however, is now
commonly called the octave, because from the first
sound, and that the gravest, which is called <i>ut</i>, as
far as to that sound which corresponds to it in the
consonance diapason, there are these eight sounds,
<i>ut</i>, <i>re</i>, <i>mi</i>, <i>fa</i>, <i>sol</i>, <i>re</i>, <i>mi</i>, <i>fa</i>. And of these the
first ut, and the last <i>fa</i>, which is the eighth, produce
the consonance diapason, or the double, or the
octave.</p>
<p class="tb">&ldquo;Again, let the same chord CD be divided into
three equal parts in the points F, G.</p>

<br />F<span class="hst"> G</span></span></p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;FD, therefore, will be two-thirds as well of the
whole CD as of the whole AB. Let the tactus
now be placed in F, and let AB and FD be struck
at the same time, and a consonance very sweet and
perfect will indeed be heard, yet not so sweet as
the diapason. This the ancients called diapente
(i.&nbsp;e. through five chords), because the first and the
fifth chord produce this consonance. But according
<span class="pb" id="Page_323">323</span>
to proportion it is called sesquialter, because the
chord AB is sesquialter to FD, and consequently
the sounds of these chords also are in the same ratio.
But sesquialter ratio is when the greater quantity
AB contains the less FD once, and the half of
it besides. It is, indeed, commonly called the
fifth, because it is composed from the first sound
<i>ut</i>, and the fifth, <i>sol</i>.</p>
<p class="tb">&ldquo;Again, let the same chord be cut into four equal
parts in the points H, E, I,</p>

</div>
<p>&ldquo;so that the chord HD, may be three-fourths of the
whole CD. The tactus, therefore, being placed in
H, let AB and HD be struck at one and the same
time, and a consonance will be heard, indeed, yet
more imperfect than the preceding two. This was
called by the ancients diatessaron, i.&nbsp;e. through
four chords or sounds, for a similar reason to that
by which the former were denominated. With reference,
however, to the ratio of the chords and
sounds, it is called sesquitertian, because the
greater AB contains the less once, and a third part
of it besides. But it is now commonly called a
<span class="pb" id="Page_324">324</span>
fourth, because it is found between the first sound
<i>ut</i>, and the fourth <i>fa</i>. If now the point F be added
in the preceding figure, and at one and the same
time two chords HD and FD are compared in
arithmetical ratios, we shall find that the greater
HD will have to the less FD a sesquioctave<a class="fn" id="fr_105" href="#fn_105">[105]</a> ratio,
and the sound of the greater HD to the less FD
will have the same ratio, i.&nbsp;e. in modern terms, that
between <i>fa</i> and <i>sol</i> there is a sesquioctave ratio.
But if these two sounds are heard together, they
will be discordant to the ear. Again, the distance
between these sounds <i>fa</i>, <i>sol</i>, or between the chords
HD and FD, or between the two harmonic intervals
HD and FD, the ratio of which was sesquioctave,
was called by the ancients a tone. Afterwards
they divided the whole of CD into nine
equal parts, the first of which is divided in K, so
that the whole CD may have to the remainder
KD, which contains eight of those parts, a sesquioctave
ratio. This, in like manner, will be the interval
of a tone, the first sound of which, i. e, of
the whole CD, is now called <i>ut</i>, but the second
sound of the rest of the chord KD is called <i>re</i>.
Afterwards they in a similar manner divided the
remainder KD into nine parts, the first part of
which is marked in the point L. And for the same
reason between the chord KD and the chord KD,
<span class="pb" id="Page_325">325</span>
and their sounds, there will be a sesquioctave ratio.
The sound of the chord LD is now called <i>mi</i>; but
the interval which remains between the chord LD
and the chord HD has not a sesquioctave ratio,
but less than it almost by half, and therefore an interval
of this kind was called a semitone, and also
diesis or a division. But that interval which remains
between the points F and E they divided
after the same manner, as the space between C and
H was divided, and they again found the same
sounds. Let those divisions be marked by the
points M and N; and here, also, between N and
E, or between <i>mi</i> and <i>fa</i>, there is in like manner
another semitone. These eight sounds, therefore,
are <i>ut</i>, <i>re</i>, <i>mi</i>, <i>fa</i>, <i>sol</i>, <i>re</i>, <i>mi</i>, <i>fa</i>, which compose
the whole diapason. For as we have before observed,
between <i>ut</i> and the last <i>fa</i> is the consonance
diapason, or between the chord CD or AB,
and the chord ED. But from the intervals which
are between the sounds there are two semitones,
viz. one between <i>mi</i> and <i>fa</i>, denoted by the letters
L, N, and the other between the last <i>mi</i> and <i>fa</i>,
denoted by the letters N, E. The remaining five
intervals are entire tones. It must, also, be observed,
that from <i>ut</i> to the first <i>sol</i> is the consonance
diapente, which contains three tonic intervals,
and one semitone; nevertheless in all there are five
sounds, <i>ut</i>, <i>re</i>, <i>mi</i>, <i>fa</i>, <i>sol</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Again, from <i>sol</i> to the last <i>fa</i> there are four
<span class="pb" id="Page_326">326</span>
sounds, <i>sol</i>, <i>re</i>, <i>mi</i>, <i>fa</i>, which are perfectly similar
to the first four, <i>ut</i>, <i>re</i>, <i>mi</i>, <i>fa</i>. Nevertheless
these are more grave, but those are more acute.
And as from <i>ut</i> to the first <i>fa</i> is the diatessaron,
so likewise from <i>sol</i> to the last <i>fa</i> is another diatessaron,
from which, in the last place, it must be
observed, it follows that the two consonances diatessaron
and diapente constitute the whole diapason;
or that the diapason is divided into one diatessaron,
and one diapente. For from <i>ut</i> to <i>sol</i> is
the diapente, but from <i>sol</i> to the last <i>fa</i> is the diatessaron.
This will also be the case if we should
say that from <i>ut</i> to the first <i>fa</i> is the diatessaron,
as is evident from the division of the chord; but
from the first <i>fa</i> to the last <i>fa</i> is the diapente, as is
evident from the four intervals of the chord, three
of which are tones, and the remaining interval is a
semitone, which also in the other diapente were
contained between <i>ut</i> and <i>sol</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now again, let the tactus be placed in I; but I
is the fourth part of the whole CD. Let, also,
AB and ID be struck at one and the same time,
and the sweetest consonance, called bisdiapason, will
be produced; which is so denominated, because it
is composed from two diapasons, of which the first
is between AB or CD, and ED, but the second is
between ED and ID; for the ratio of these is
double as well as of those. The ratio, also, of
the bisdiapason is quadruple, as is evident from
<span class="pb" id="Page_327">327</span>
the division; and is commonly called a fifteenth,
because from the first <i>ut</i> to this sound, which is
also denominated <i>fa</i>, there would be fifteen sounds,
if the interval EI were divided after the same
manner as the first CE is divided.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Farther still, let GD be a third part of the whole
CD, and let the tactus be placed in G. Then at
one and the same time let AB and GD be struck,
and a sweet consonance will be heard, which is
called diapasondiapente, because it is composed
from one diapason contained by the interval CE,
or the two chords CD, ED, and one diapente,
contained by the interval EG, or the chords ED,
GD. For the chord ED is sesquialter to the
chord GD; which ratio constitutes the nature of
the diapente. The proportion, also, of this consonance
is triple. For the chord AB or CD is
triple of GD; and it is commonly called the
twelfth, because between <i>ut</i> and <i>sol</i>, denoted by the
letter G, there would be twelve sounds, if the interval
EG received its divisions. From all which it
is manifest by the experience of the ear, that there
are altogether five consonances, three simple, the
diapason, the diapente, and the diatessaron; but
two composite, the bisdiapason, and the diapasondiapente.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the last place, it is necessary to observe that
those ancient Greeks differently denominated these
sounds, <i>ut</i>, <i>re</i>, &amp;c. For the first, i.&nbsp;e. the gravest
<span class="pb" id="Page_328">328</span>
sound or chord, which is now called <i>ut</i>, they, denominated
hypate, and the others in the following
order:</p>

<p class="revint"><a id="en21" href="#er21">P. 109.</a> <i>I swear by him who the tetractys
found.</i></p>
<p>The tetrad was called by the Pythagoreans every
number, because it comprehends in itself all the
numbers as far as to the decad, and the decad
itself; for the sum of 1, 2, 3, and 4, is 10. Hence
both the decad and the tetrad were said by them to
be every number; the decad indeed in energy, but
the tetrad in capacity. The sum likewise of these
four numbers was said by them to constitute the
tetractys, in which all harmonic ratios are included.
For 4 to 1, which is a quadruple ratio, forms the
symphony bisdiapason; the ratio of 3 to 2, which
is sesquialter, forms the symphony diapente; 4 to
<span class="pb" id="Page_329">329</span>
3, which is sesquitertian, the symphony diatessaron;
and 2 to 1, which is a duple ratio, forms the
diapason.</p>
<p>In consequence, however, of the great veneration
paid to the tetractys by the Pythagoreans, it
will be proper to give it a more ample discussion,
and for this purpose to show from Theo of Smyrna,<a class="fn" id="fr_106" href="#fn_106">[106]</a>
how many tetractys there are: &ldquo;The tetractys,&rdquo;
says he, &ldquo;was not only principally honored by
the Pythagoreans, because all symphonies are
found to exist within it, but also because it appears
to contain the nature of all things.&rdquo; Hence
the following was their oath: &ldquo;Not by him who
delivered to our soul the tetractys, which contains
the fountain and root of everlasting nature.&rdquo; But
by him who delivered the tetractys they mean Pythagoras;
for the doctrine concerning it appears
to have been his invention. The above-mentioned
tetractys, therefore, is seen in the composition of
the first numbers 1. 2. 3. 4. But the second tetractys
arises from the increase by multiplication of
even and odd numbers beginning from the monad.</p>
<p>Of these, the monad is assumed as the first, because,
as we have before observed, it is the principle
of all even, odd, and evenly-odd numbers, and
the nature of it is simple. But the three successive
numbers receive their composition according to
<span class="pb" id="Page_330">330</span>
the even and the odd; because every number is
not alone even, nor alone odd. Hence the even
and the odd receive two tetractys, according to
multiplication; the even indeed, in a duple ratio;
for 2 is the first of even numbers, and increases
from the monad by duplication. But the odd number
is increased in a triple ratio; for 3 is the first
of odd numbers, and is itself increased from the
monad by triplication. Hence the monad is common
to both these, being itself even and odd. The
second number, however, in even and double numbers
is 2; but in odd and triple numbers 3. The
third among even numbers is 4; but among odd
numbers is 9. And the fourth among even numbers
is 8; but among odd numbers is 27.</p>
<p class="center">{ 1. 2. 4. &nbsp;8. }
<br />{ 1. 3. 9. 27. }</p>
<p>In these numbers the more perfect ratios of
symphonies are found; and in these also a tone is
comprehended. The monad, however, contains the
productive principle of a point. But the second
numbers 2 and 3 contain the principle of a side,
since they are incomposite, and first, are measured
by the monad, and naturally measure a right line.
The third terms are 4 and 9, which are in power
a square superficies, since they are equally equal.
And the fourth terms 8 and 27 being equally equally
equal, are in power a cube. Hence from these
<span class="pb" id="Page_331">331</span>
numbers, and this tetractys, the increase takes
place from a point to a solid. For a side follows
after a point, a superficies after a side, and a solid
after a superficies. In these numbers also, Plato
in the Tim&aelig;us constitutes the soul. But the last
of these seven numbers, i.&nbsp;e. 27, is equal to all the
numbers that precede it; for 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 8 + 9
= 27. There are, therefore, two tetractys of numbers,
one of which subsists by addition, but the
other by multiplication, and they comprehend musical,
geometrical, and arithmetical ratios, from
which also the harmony of the universe consists.</p>
<p>But the third tetractys is that which according
to the same analogy or proportion comprehends the
nature of all magnitude. For what the monad was
in the former tetractys, that a point is in this.
What the numbers 2 and 3, which are in power a
side, were in the former tetractys, that the extended
species of a line, the circular and the right, are in
this; the right line indeed subsisting in conformity
to the even number, since it is terminated<a class="fn" id="fr_107" href="#fn_107">[107]</a> by two
points; but the circular in conformity to the odd
number, because it is comprehended by one line
which has no end. But what in the former tetractys
the square numbers 4 and 9 were, that the two-fold
<span class="pb" id="Page_332">332</span>
species of planes, the rectilinear and the circular,
are in this. And what the cube numbers 8
and 27 were in the former, the one being an even,
but the other an odd number, that the two solids,
one of which has a hollow superficies, as the sphere
and the cylinder, but the other a plane superficies,
as the cube and pyramid, are in this tetractys.
Hence, this is the third tetractys, which gives completion
to every magnitude, from a point, a line, a
superficies, and a solid.</p>
<p>The fourth tetractys is of the simple bodies fire,
air, water, and earth, which have an analogy according
to numbers. For what the monad was in
the first tetractys, that fire is in this. But the
duad is air, the triad is water, and the tetrad is
earth. For such is the nature of the elements according
to tenuity and density of parts. Hence
fire has to air the ratio of 1 to 2; but to water, the
ratio of 1 to 3; and to earth, the ratio of 1 to 4.
In other respects also they are analogous to each
other.</p>
<p>The fifth tetractys is of the figures of the simple
bodies. For the pyramid, indeed, is the figure
of fire; the octaedron, of air; the icosaedron,
of water; and the cube, of earth.</p>
<p>The sixth tetractys is of things rising into existence
through the vegetative life. And the seed,
indeed, is analogous to the monad and a point.
<span class="pb" id="Page_333">333</span>
But if it increases in length it is analogous to the
duad and a line; if in breadth, to the triad and a
superficies; but if in thickness, to the tetrad and a
solid.</p>
<p>The seventh tetractys is of communities; of
which the principle indeed, and as it were monad,
is man; the duad is a house; the triad a street;
and the tetrad a city. For a nation consists of
these. And these indeed are the material and
sensible tetractys.</p>
<p>The eighth tetractys consists of the powers which
form a judgment of things material and sensible,
and which are of a certain intelligible nature. And
these are, intellect, science, opinion, and sense.
And intellect, indeed, corresponds in its essence to
the monad; but science to the duad; for science is
the science of a certain thing. Opinion subsists
between science and ignorance; but sense is as the
tetrad. For the touch which is common to all the
senses being fourfold, all the senses energize according
to contact.</p>
<p>The ninth tetractys is that from which the animal
is composed, the soul and the body. For the
parts of the soul, indeed, are the rational, the
irascible, and the epithymetic, or that which desires
external good; and the fourth is the body in which
the soul subsists.</p>
<p>The tenth tetractys is of the seasons of the year,
<span class="pb" id="Page_334">334</span>
through which all things rise into existence, viz. the
spring, the summer, the autumn, and the winter.</p>
<p>And the eleventh is of the ages of man, viz. of
the infant, the lad, the man, and the old man.</p>
<p>Hence there are eleven tetractys. The first is
that which subsists according to the composition of
numbers. The second, according to the multiplication
of numbers. The third subsists according
to magnitude. The fourth is of the simple bodies.
The fifth is of figures. The sixth is of things rising
into existence through the vegetative life. The
seventh is of communities. The eighth is the judicial
power. The ninth is of the parts of the
animal. The tenth is of the seasons of the year.
And the eleventh is of the ages of man. All of
them however are proportional to each other. For
what the monad is in the first and second tetractys,
that a point is in the third; fire in the fourth; a
pyramid in the fifth; seed in the sixth; man in the
seventh; intellect in the eighth; and so of the rest.
Thus, for instance, the first tetractys is 1. 2. 3. 4.
The second is the monad, a side, a square, and a
cube. The third is a point, a line, a superficies,
and a solid. The fourth is fire, air, water, earth.
The fifth the pyramid, the octaedron, the icosaedron,
and the cube. The sixth, seed, length,
breadth and depth. The seventh, man, a house, a
street, a city. The eighth, intellect, science, opinion,
<span class="pb" id="Page_335">335</span>
sense. The ninth, the rational, the irascible, and
the epithymetic parts, and the body. The tenth,
the spring, summer, autumn, winter. The eleventh,
the infant, the lad, the man, and the old man.</p>
<p>The world also, which is composed from these
tetractys, is perfect, being elegantly arranged in
geometrical, harmonical, and arithmetical proportion;
comprehending every power, all the nature
of number, every magnitude, and every simple and
composite body. But it is perfect, because all
things are the parts of it, but it is not itself the
part of any thing. Hence, the Pythagoreans are
said to have first used the before-mentioned oath,
and also the assertion that &ldquo;all things are assimilated
to number.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="revint"><a id="en22" href="#er22">P. 111.</a> <i>This number is the first that partakes
of every number, and when divided in every
possible way, receives the power of the numbers
subtracted, and of those that remain.</i></p>
<p>Because 6 consists of 1, 2 and 3, the two first
of which are the principles of all number, and
also because 2 and 3 are the first even and odd,
which are the sources of all the species of numbers;
the number 6 may be said to partake of every
number. In what Iamblichus afterwards adds, I
<span class="pb" id="Page_336">336</span>
suppose he alludes to 6 being a perfect number and
therefore equal to all its parts.</p>
<p class="revint"><a id="en23" href="#er23">P. 134.</a> <i>Not to step above the beam of the
balance.</i></p>
<p>This is the 14th Symbol in the Protreptics of
Iamblichus, whose explanation of it is as follows:
&ldquo;This symbol exhorts us to the exercise of justice,
to the honoring equality and moderation in an admirable
degree, and to the knowledge of justice as
the most perfect virtue, to which the other virtues
give completion, and without which none of the rest
are of any advantage. It also admonishes us, that
it is proper to know this virtue not in a careless
manner, but through theorems and scientific demonstrations.
But this knowledge is the business
of no other art and science than the Pythagoric
philosophy alone, which in a transcendent degree
honors disciplines before every thing else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The following extract also from my Theoretic
Arithmetic, (p. 194.), will in a still greater degree
elucidate this symbol. The information contained
in it is derived from the anonymous author of a
very valuable work entitled<span title="Theologoumena Arithm&ecirc;tik&ecirc;s" class="g"> &Theta;&epsilon;&omicron;&lambda;&omicron;&gamma;&omicron;&upsilon;&mu;&epsilon;&nu;&alpha; &Alpha;&rho;&iota;&theta;&mu;&eta;&tau;&iota;&kappa;&eta;&sigmaf;</span>
<i>Theologumena Arithmetic&aelig;</i>, and which has
lately been reprinted at Leipsic, &ldquo;The Pythagoreans
<span class="pb" id="Page_337">337</span>
called the pentad providence and justice,
because it equalizes things unequal, justice being a
medium between excess and defect, just as 5 is the
middle of all the numbers that are equally distant
from it on both sides as far as to the decad, some
of which it surpasses, and by others is surpassed,
as may be seen in the following arrangement:</p>
<p class="center">1. 4. 7.
<br />2. 5. 8.
<br />3. 6. 9.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For here, as in the middle of the beam of a balance,
5 does not depart from the line of the equilibrium,
while one scale is raised, and the other is depressed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the following arrangement also, viz. 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, it will be found that the sum of
the numbers which are posterior, is triple the sum
of those that are prior to 5; for 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 = 30;
but 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10. If therefore the numbers
on each side of 5 represent the beam of a balance,
5 being the tongue of it, when a weight depresses
the beam, an obtuse angle is produced by the depressed
part with the tongue, and an acute angle by
the elevated part of the beam. Hence it is worse
to do than to suffer an injury: and the authors of
the injury verge downward as it were to the infernal
regions; but the injured tend upward as it were to
the Gods, imploring the divine assistance. Hence
the meaning of the Pythagoric symbol is obvious,
&ldquo;Pass not above the beam of the balance.&rdquo; Since
<span class="pb" id="Page_338">338</span>
however injustice pertains to inequality, in order to
correct this, equalization is requisite, that the beam
of the balance may remain on both sides without
obliquity. But equalization is effected by addition
and subtraction. Thus if 4 is added to 5, and 4
is also taken from 5, the number 9 will be produced
on one side, and 1 on the other, each of which is
equally distant from 5. Thus too, if 3 is added to
5, and is also subtracted from it, on the one side 8
will be produced, and on the other 2. If 2 is added
to 5, and likewise taken from it, 7 and 3 will be
produced. And by adding 1 to 5, and subtracting
3 from it, 6 and 4 will be the result; in all which
instances, the numbers produced are equidistant
from 5, and the sum of each couple is equal to 10.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="revint"><a id="en24" href="#er24">P. 161.</a> <i>Such as dig not fire with a sword.</i></p>
<p>This is the 9th Symbol in the Protreptics, and is
thus explained by Iamblichus. &ldquo;This symbol exhorts
to prudence. For it excites in us an appropriate
conception with respect to the propriety of
not opposing sharp words to a man full of fire and
wrath, nor contending with him. For frequently
by words you will agitate and disturb an ignorant
man, and will yourself suffer things dreadful and
unpleasant.&rdquo; Heraclitus also testifies to the truth
of this symbol. For he says, &ldquo;It is difficult to
<span class="pb" id="Page_339">339</span>
fight with anger: for whatever is necessary to be
done redeems the soul.&rdquo; And this he says truly.
For many, by gratifying anger, have changed the
condition of their soul, and have made death preferable
to life. But by governing the tongue, and
being quiet, friendship is produced from strife, the
fire of anger being extinguished; and you yourself
will not appear to be destitute of intellect.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="revint"><a id="en25" href="#er25">P. 200.</a> <i>But this follows from the whole being
naturally prior to the part, and not the part
to the whole.</i></p>
<p>For whole co-subverts, but is not co-subverted
by part: since if whole is taken away, part also is
taken away; but the contrary does not follow.</p>
<p class="revint"><a id="en26" href="#er26">P. 231.</a> <i>Such therefore as hope the intellective
and gnostic part of virtue, are denominated
skilful and intelligent; but such as have the
ethical and pre-elective part of it, are denominated
useful and equitable.</i></p>
<p>The following account of the virtues is extracted
from the Notes to my Translation of the Ph&aelig;do of
Plato: The first of the virtues are the physical,
which are common to brutes, being mingled with
<span class="pb" id="Page_340">340</span>
the temperaments, and for the most part contrary
to each other; or rather pertaining to the animal.
Or it may be said that they are illuminations from
reason, when not impeded by a certain bad temperament:
or that they are the result of energies in a
former life. Of these Plato speaks in the Politicus
and the Laws. The ethical virtues, which are
above these, are ingenerated by custom and a
certain right opinion, and are the virtues of children
when well educated. These virtues also are to be
found in some brute animals. They likewise
transcend the temperaments, and on this account
are not contrary to each other. These virtues Plato
delivers in the Laws. They pertain however at the
same time both to reason and the irrational nature.
In the third rank above these are the political virtues,
which pertain to reason alone; for they are scientific.
But they are the virtues of reason adorning
the irrational part as its instrument; through prudence
adorning the gnostic, through fortitude the
irascible, and through temperance the epithymetic
power, (or the power which is the source of desire;)
but adorning all the parts of the irrational nature
through justice. And of these virtues Plato speaks
much in the Republic. These virtues too follow
each other. Above these are the cathartic virtues,
which pertain to reason alone, withdrawing from
other things to itself, throwing aside the instruments
of sense as vain, repressing also the energies through
<span class="pb" id="Page_341">341</span>
these instruments, and liberating the soul from the
bonds of generation. Plato particularly unfolds
these virtues in the Ph&aelig;do. Prior to these however
are the theoretic virtues, which pertain to the
soul, introducing itself to natures superior to itself,
not only gnostically, as some one may be induced
to think from the name, but also orectically: for
it hastens to become, as it were, intellect instead of
soul; and intellect possesses both desire and
knowledge. These virtues are the converse of the
political: for as the latter energize about things
subordinate according to reason, so the former
about things more excellent according to intellect.
These virtues Plato delivers in the The&aelig;tetus.</p>
<p>According to Plotinus, there is also another
gradation of the virtues besides these, viz, the paradigmatic.
For, as our eye, when it is first illuminated
by the solar light, is different from that which illuminates,
as being illuminated, but afterwards is in
a certain respect united and conjoined with it, and
becomes, as it were, solar-form; so also our soul
at first indeed is illuminated by intellect, and energizes
according to the theoretic virtues, but afterwards
becomes, as it were, that which is illuminated,
and energizes uniformly according to the paradigmatic
virtues. And it is the business indeed of
philosophy to make us intellect; but of theurgy to
unite us to intelligibles, so that we may energize
paradigmatically. And as when possessing the
<span class="pb" id="Page_342">342</span>
physical virtues, we know mundane bodies (for the
subjects to virtues of this kind are bodies); so from
possessing the ethical virtues, we know the fate of
the Universe, because fate is conversant with irrational
lives. For the rational soul is not under
fate; and the ethical virtues are irrational, because
they pertain to the irrational part. According to
the political virtues we know mundane affairs, and
according to the cathartic supermundane; but as
possessing the theoretic we know intellectual, and
from the paradigmatic intelligible natures. Temperance
also pertains to the ethical virtues; justice
to the political, on account of compacts; fortitude
to the cathartic, through not verging to matter;
and prudence to the theoretic. Observe too, that
Plato in the Ph&aelig;do calls the physical virtues servile,
because they may subsist in servile souls; but he
calls the ethical <span title="skiographiai" class="g">&sigma;&kappa;&iota;&omicron;&gamma;&rho;&alpha;&phi;&iota;&alpha;&iota;</span> <i>adumbrations</i>, because
their possessors only know <i>that</i> the energies of such
virtues are right, but do not know <i>why</i> they are so.
It is well observed too here, by Olympiodorus,
that Plato calls the cathartic and theoretic virtues,
those which are in reality true virtues. He also
separates them in another way, viz. that the political
are not telestic, i.&nbsp;e. do not pertain to mystic ceremonies,
but that the cathartic and theoretic are
telestic. Hence, Olympiodorus adds, the cathartic
virtues are denominated from the purification which
is used in the mysteries; but the theoretic from
<span class="pb" id="Page_343">343</span>
perceiving things divine. On this account he accords
with the Orphic verses, that</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">The soul that uninitiated dies,</p>
<p class="t0">Plung&rsquo;d in the blackest mire in Hades lies.</p>
</div>
<p>For initiation is the divinely-inspired energy of the
virtues. Olympiodorus also further observes, that
by the thyrsus-bearers, Plato means those that
energize according to the political virtues, but by
the Bacchuses those that exercise the cathartic virtues.
For we are bound in matter as Titans,
through the great partibility of our nature; but we
rise from the dark mire as Bacchuses. Hence we
become more prophetic at the time of death: and
Bacchus is the inspective guardian of death, because
he is likewise of every thing pertaining to the
Bacchic sacred rites.</p>
<p>All the virtues likewise exhibit their proper
characters, these being every where common, but
subsisting appropriately in each. For the characteristic
property of fortitude is the not declining to
things subordinate; of temperance, a conversion
from an inferior nature; of justice, a proper energy,
and which is adapted to being; and of prudence,
the election and selection of things good and evil.
Olympiodorus farther observes, that all the virtues
are in the Gods. For many Gods, says he, are
adorned with their appellations; and all goodness
originates from the Gods. Likewise, prior, to
things which sometimes participate the virtues, as
<span class="pb" id="Page_344">344</span>
is our case, it is necessary there should be natures
which always participate them. In what order,
therefore, do the virtues appear? Shall we say in
the psychical? For virtue is the perfection of the
soul; and election and pre-election are the energies
and projections of the soul. Hence the Chald&aelig;an
oracles conjoin fontal virtue with fontal soul,
or in other words, with soul subsisting according to
cause. But may it not also be said, that the virtues
naturally wish to give an orderly arrangement
to that which is disordered? If this be admitted,
they will originate from the demiurgic order. How
then will they be cathartic there? May we not
say, Olympiodorus adds, that through the cathartic
virtues considered according to their causal subsistence
in Jupiter the demiurgus, he is enabled to
abide in his accustomed mode, as Plato says in the
Tim&aelig;us? And farther still, according to ancient
theologists, he ascends to the tower of Saturn, who
is a <i>pure</i> intellect.</p>
<p>As this distribution of the virtues, however, is at
present no less novel than important, the following
discussion of them from the <span title="Aphormai pros ta no&ecirc;ta" class="g">&Alpha;&phi;&omicron;&rho;&mu;&alpha;&iota; &pi;&rho;&omicron;&sigmaf; &tau;&alpha; &nu;&omicron;&eta;&tau;&alpha;</span>,
or <span class="sc">Auxiliaries to Intelligibles</span>, of Porphyry,
is added for the sake of the genuinely philosophic
reader:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is one kind of virtues pertaining to the
political character, and another to the man who
tends to contemplation, and on this account is
<span class="pb" id="Page_345">345</span>
called theoretic, and is now a beholder. And
there are also other virtues pertaining to intellect,
so far as it is intellect, and separate from soul.
The virtues indeed of the political character, and
which consist in the moderation of the passions,
are characterised by following and being obedient
to the reasoning about that which is becoming in
actions. Hence, looking to an innoxious converse
with neighbours, they are denominated, from the
aggregation of fellowship, political. And prudence
indeed subsists about the reasoning part; fortitude
about the irascible part; temperance, in the consent
and symphony of the epithymetic with the reasoning
part; and justice in each of these performing
its proper employment with respect to governing
and being governed. But the virtues of him
who proceeds to the contemplative life, consist in a
departure from terrestrial concerns. Hence also,
they are called purifications, being surveyed in the
refraining from corporeal actions, and avoiding
sympathies with the body. For these are the virtues
of the soul elevating itself to true being. The
political virtues, therefore, adorn the mortal man,
and are the forerunners of purifications. For it is
necessary that he who is adorned by these, should
abstain from doing any thing precedaneously in
conjunction with body. Hence in purifications, not
to opine with body, but to energize alone, gives subsistence
to prudence; which derives its perfection
<span class="pb" id="Page_346">346</span>
through energizing intellectually with purity. But
not to be similarly passive with the body, constitutes
temperance. Not to fear a departure from
body as into something void, and nonentity, gives
subsistence to fortitude. But when reason and intellect
are the leaders, and there is no resistance
[from the irrational part,] justice is produced. The
disposition therefore, according to the political virtues,
is surveyed in the moderation of the passions;
having for its end to live as man conformable to
nature. But the disposition according to the theoretic
virtues, is beheld in apathy;<a class="fn" id="fr_108" href="#fn_108">[108]</a> the end of
which is a similitude to God.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since, however, of purification one kind consists
in purifying, but another pertains to those that
are purified, the cathartic virtues are surveyed according
to both these significations of purification;
for they purify the soul, and are present with purification.
For the end of purification is to become
pure. But since purification, and the being purified,
are an ablation of every thing foreign, the
good resulting from them will be different from that
which purifies; so that if that which is purified was
good prior to the impurity with which it is defiled,
purification is sufficient. That, however, which remains
after purification, is good, and not purification.
<span class="pb" id="Page_347">347</span>
The nature of the soul also was not good,
but is that which is able to partake of good, and is
boniform. For if this were not the case, it would
not have become situated in evil. The good,
therefore, of the soul consists in being united to
its generator; but its evil, in an association with
things subordinate to itself. Its evil also is two-fold;
the one arising from an association with terrestrial
natures; but the other from doing this with
an excess of the passions. Hence all the political
virtues, which liberate the soul from one evil, may
be denominated virtues, and are honorable. But
the cathartic are more honorable, and liberate it
from evil, so far as it is soul. It is necessary,
therefore, that the soul when purified should associate
with its generator. Hence the virtue of it
after its conversion consists in a scientific knowledge
of [true] being; but this will not be the case
unless conversion, precedes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is therefore another genus of virtues
after the cathartic and political, and which are the
virtues of the soul energizing intellectually. And
here, indeed, wisdom and prudence consist in the
contemplation of those things which intellect possesses.
But justice consists in performing what is
appropriate in a conformity to, and energizing according
to intellect. Temperance is an inward
conversion of the soul to intellect. And fortitude
is apathy; according to a similitude of that to
<span class="pb" id="Page_348">348</span>
which the soul looks, and which is naturally impassive.
These virtues also, in the same manner
as the others, alternately follow each other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fourth species of the virtues, is that of the
paradigms subsisting in intellect; which are more
excellent than the psychical virtues, and exist as
the paradigms of these; the virtues of the soul
being the similitudes of them. And intellect indeed
is that in which all things subsist at once as
paradigms. Here, therefore, prudence is science;
but intellect that knows [all things] is wisdom.
Temperance is that which is converted to itself.
The proper work of intellect, is the performance of
its appropriate duty, [and this is justice<a class="fn" id="fr_109" href="#fn_109">[109]</a>]. But
fortitude is sameness, and the abiding with purity
in itself, through an abundance of power. There
are therefore four genera of virtues; of which, indeed,
some pertain to intellect, concur with the essence
of it, and are paradigmatic. Others pertain
to soul now looking to intellect, and being filled
from it. Others belong to the soul of man, purifying
itself, and becoming purified from the body,
and the irrational passions. And others are the
virtues of the soul of man, adorning the man,
through giving measure and bound to the irrational
nature, and producing moderation in the passions.
<span class="pb" id="Page_349">349</span>
And he, indeed, who has the greater virtues has
also necessarily the less; but the contrary is not
true, that he who has the less has also the greater
virtues. Nor will he who possesses the greater,
energize precedaneously according to the less, but
only so far as the necessities of the mortal nature
require. The scope also of the virtues, is, as we
have said, generically different in the different virtues.
For the scope of the political virtues, is to
give measure to the passions in their practical energies
according to nature. But the scope of the cathartic
virtues, is entirely to obliterate the remembrance
of the passions. And the scope of the rest
subsists analogously to what has been before said.
Hence, he who energizes according to the practical
virtues, is a <i>worthy</i> man: but he who energizes
according to the cathartic virtues, is <i>a d&aelig;moniacal
man</i>, or is also <i>a good d&aelig;mon</i>. He who energizes
according to the intellectual virtues alone, is <i>a God</i>.
But he who energizes according to the paradigmatic
virtues, <i>is the father of the Gods</i>. We, therefore,
ought especially to pay attention to the cathartic
virtues, since we may obtain these in the
present life. But through these, the ascent is to
the more honorable virtues. Hence it is requisite
to survey to what degree purification may be extended.
For it is a separation from body, and
from the passive motion of the irrational part.
<span class="pb" id="Page_350">350</span>
But how this may so effected, and to what extent,
must now be said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the first place, indeed, it is necessary that
he who intends to acquire this purification, should,
as the foundation and basis of it, know himself to
be a soul bound in a foreign thing, and in a different
essence. In the second place, as that which
is raised from this foundation, he should collect
himself from the body, and as it different
places, so as to be disposed in a manner perfectly
impassive with respect to the body. For he
who energizes uninterruptedly according to sense,
though he may not do this with an adhering affection,
and the enjoyment resulting from pleasure,
yet at the same time his attention is dissipated
about the body, in consequence of becoming
through sense<a class="fn" id="fr_110" href="#fn_110">[110]</a> in contact with it. But we are
addicted to the pleasures or pains of sensibles, in
conjunction with a promptitude, and converging
sympathy; from which disposition it is requisite to
be purified. <i>This, however, will be effected by admitting
necessary pleasures, and the sensations of
them, merely as remedies, or as a liberation from
pain, in order that</i> [<i>the rational part</i>] <i>may not be
impeded</i> [<i>in its energies.</i>] Pain also must be taken
away. But if this is not possible, it must be mildly
<span class="pb" id="Page_351">351</span>
diminished. And it will be diminished, if the soul
is not co-passive with it. Anger, likewise, must as
much as possible be taken away; and must by no
means be premeditated. But if it cannot be entirely
removed, deliberate choice must not be
mingled with it, but the unpremeditated motion
must be the impulse of the irrational part. <i>That
however which is unpremeditated is imbecile and
small.</i> All fear, likewise, must be expelled. For
he who acquires this purification, will fear nothing.
Here, however, if it should take place, it will be
unpremeditated. Anger therefore and fear must
be used for the purpose of admonition. But the
desire of every thing base must be exterminated.
Such a one also, so far as he is a cathartic philosopher,
will not desire meats and drinks. Neither
must there be the unpremeditated in natural venereal
connexions; <i>but if this should take place, it
must only be as far as to that precipitate imagination
which energizes in sleep</i>. In short, the intellectual
soul itself of the purified man, must be liberated
from all these [corporeal propensities.] He
must likewise endeavour that what is moved to the
irrational nature of corporeal passions, may be
moved without sympathy, and without animadversion;
so that the motions themselves may be immediately dissolved,
through their vicinity to the
reasoning power. This, however, will not take
place while the purification is proceeding to its perfection;
<span class="pb" id="Page_352">352</span>
but will happen to those in whom reason
rules without opposition. Hence in these, the inferior
part will so venerate reason, that it will be
indignant if it is at all moved, in consequence of
not being quiet when its master is present, and will
reprove itself for its imbecility. These, however,
are yet only moderations of the passions, but at
length terminate in apathy, for when co-passivity
is entirely exterminated, then apathy is present with
him who is purified from it. For passion becomes
moved, when reason imparts excitation, through
verging [to the irrational nature.]&rdquo;</p>

connected with Pytha&iuml;s; for this would be absurd in the extreme;
but the assertion of Epimenides, Eudoxus, and Xenocrates
must be considered as one of those mythological narrations
in which heroes are said to have Gods for their fathers,
or Goddesses for their mothers, and the true meaning of it is
as follows: According to the ancient theology, between those
perpetual attendants of a divine nature called <i>essential</i> heroes,
who are impassive and pure, and the bulk of human souls who
descend to earth with passivity and impurity, it is necessary
there should be an order of human souls who descend with impassivity
and purity. For as there is no vacuum either in
incorporeal or corporeal natures, it is necessary that the last
link of a superior order, should coalesce with the summit of
one proximately inferior. These souls were called by the
ancients, <i>terrestrial</i> heroes, on account of their high degree of
proximity and alliance to such as are essentially heroes. Hercules,
Theseus, Pythagoras, Plato, &amp;c. were souls of this kind,
who descended into mortality both to benefit other souls, and
in compliance with that necessity by which all natures inferior
to the perpetual attendants of the Gods are at times obliged
to descend.</div>
<div class="fncont">But as, according to the arcana of ancient theology, every
God beginning from on high produces his proper series as far
as to the last of things, and this series comprehends many essences
different from each other, such as D&aelig;moniacal, Heroical,
Nymphical, and the like; the lowest powers of these
orders, have a great communion and physical sympathy with
the human race, and contribute to the perfection of all their
natural operations, and particularly to their procreations.
&ldquo;Hence&rdquo; (says Proclus in MSS. Schol. in Crat.) &ldquo;it often appears,
that <i>heroes</i> are generated from the mixture of these
powers with mankind; for those that possess a certain prerogative
above human nature, are properly denominated <i>heroes</i>.&rdquo;
He adds: &ldquo;Not only a d&aelig;moniacal genus of this kind sympathizes
physically with men, but other kinds sympathize with
other natures, as Nymphs with trees, others with fountains,
and others with stags or serpents.&rdquo;</div>
<div class="fncont">Olympiodorus, in his life of Plato, observes of that philosopher,
&ldquo;That an Apolloniacal spectre is said to have had connexion
with Perictione his mother, and that appearing in the
night to his father Aristo, it commanded him not to sleep with
Perictione during the time of her pregnancy; which mandate
Aristo obeyed.&rdquo; The like account of the divine origin of
Plato, is also given by Apuleius, Plutarch, and Hesychius.

</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_11" href="#fr_11">[11]</a>From what has been said in the note, <a href="#Page_4">p. 4</a>, respecting the
divine origin of Pythagoras, it follows that he was a <i>terrestrial
hero</i> belonging to the series of Apollo. Thus too the Esculapius
who once lived on the earth, and was the inventor of
medicine, proceeded, according to the ancient mythology,
from the God Esculapius, who subsists in Apollo, just as the
hero Bacchus proceeded from the Bacchus who subsists in
Jupiter. Hence the Emperor Julian (apud Cyril.) says of
Esculapius: &ldquo;I had almost forgotten the greatest of the gifts
of Jupiter and the Sun, but I have very properly reserved it
to the last. For it is not peculiar to us only, but is common
also, I think, to our kindred the Greeks. For Jupiter, in
intelligibles, generated from himself Esculapius; but he was
unfolded into light on the earth, through the prolific light of
the sun. He therefore, proceeding from heaven to the earth,
appeared uniformly in a human shape about Epidaurus. But
thence becoming multiplied in his progressions, he extended
his saving right hand to all the earth. He came to Pergamus,
to Ionia, to Tarentum, and afterwards to Rome. Thence he
went to the island Co, afterwards to &AElig;gas, and at length to
wherever there is land and sea. Nor did we individually, but
collectively, experience his beneficence. And at one and the
same time, he corrected souls that were wandering in error,
and bodies that were infirm.&rdquo;

</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_13" href="#fr_13">[13]</a>This inventor of names was called by the Egyptians
Theuth, as we are informed by Plato in the Philebus and
Ph&aelig;drus; in the latter of which dialogues, Socrates says: &ldquo;I
have heard, that about Naucratis in Egypt, there was one of
the ancient Gods of the Egyptians, to whom a bird was sacred,
which they call Ibis; but the name of the d&aelig;mon himself was
Theuth. According to tradition, this God first discovered
number and the art of reckoning, geometry and astronomy, the
games of chess and hazard, and likewise letters.&rdquo; On this
passage I observe as follows, in Vol. 3. of my translation of
Plato: The genus of disciplines belonging to Mercury, contains
gymnastic, music, arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and
the art of speaking and writing. This God, as he is the
source of invention, is called the son of Maia; because <i>investigation</i>,
which is implied by <i>Maia</i>, produces <i>invention</i>: and
as unfolding the will of Jupiter, who is an intellectual God,
he is the cause of mathesis or discipline. He first subsists in
Jupiter, the artificer of the world; next among the supermundane
Gods; in the third place, among the liberated Gods;
fourthly, in the planet Mercury; fifthly, in the Mercurial
order of d&aelig;mons; sixthly, in human souls, who are the attendants
of this God; and in the seventh degree, his properties
subsist in certain animals, such as the ibis, the ape, and sagacious
dogs. The narration of Socrates in this place, is both
allegorical and anagogic or reductory. Naucratis is a region
of Egypt eminently subject to the influence of Mercury,
though the whole of Egypt is allotted to this divinity. Likewise,
in this city a man once florished full of the Mercurial
power, because his soul formerly existed in the heavens of the
Mercurial order. But he was first called Theuth, that is,
Mercury, and a God, because his soul subsisted according to
the perfect similitude of this divinity. But afterwards a
d&aelig;mon, because from the God Mercury, through a Mercurial
d&aelig;mon, gifts of this kind are transmitted to a Mercurial
soul.

</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_17" href="#fr_17">[17]</a>&ldquo;The Pythagoreans,&rdquo; says Simplicius, in his Commentary
on the 2d book of Aristotle&rsquo;s treatise On the Heavens, said, &ldquo;that
an harmonic sound was produced from the motion of the celestial
bodies, and they scientifically collected this from the
analogy of their intervals; since not only the ratios of the sun
and moon, of Venus and Mercury, but also of the other stars,
were discovered by them.&rdquo; Simplicius adds, &ldquo;Perhaps the
objection of Aristotle to this assertion of the Pythagoreans, may
be solved according to the philosophy of those men, as follows:</div>
<div class="fncont">&ldquo;All things are not commensurate with each other, nor is every
thing sensible to every thing, even in the sublunary region.
This is evident from dogs who scent animals at a great
distance, and which are not smelt by men. How much more,
therefore, in things which are separated by so great an interval
as those which are incorruptible from the corruptible, and
celestial from terrestrial natures, is it true to say, that the sound
of divine bodies is not audible by terrestrial ears? But if any
one like Pythagoras, who is reported to have heard this harmony,
should have his terrestrial body exempt from him, and
his luminous and celestial vehicle<a class="fn" href="#fn_17a">[17a]</a> and the senses which it
contains purified, either through a good allotment, or through
probity of life, or through a perfection arising from sacred operations,
such a one will perceive things invisible to others, and
will hear things inaudible by others. With respect to divine
and immaterial bodies, however, if any sound is produced by
them, it is neither percussive nor destructive, but it excites the
powers and energies of sublunary sounds, and perfects the sense
which is co-ordinate with them. It has also a certain analogy
to the sound which concurs with the motion of terrestrial bodies.
But the sound which is with us in consequence of the
sonorific nature of the air, is a certain energy of the motion of
their impassive sound. If, then, air is not passive there, it is
evident that neither will the sound which is there be passive.
Pythagoras, however, seems to have said that he heard the celestial
harmony, as understanding the harmonic proportions in
numbers, of the heavenly bodies, and that which is audible in
them. Some one, however, may very properly doubt why the
stars are seen by our visive sense, but the sound of them is not
heard by our ears? To this we reply that neither do we see
the stars themselves; for we do not see their magnitudes, or
their figures, or their surpassing beauty. Neither do we see the
motion through which the sound is produced; but we see as it
were such an illumination of them, as that of the light of the
sun about the earth, the sun himself not being seen by us.
Perhaps too, neither will it be wonderful, that the visive sense,
as being more immaterial, subsisting rather according to energy
than according to passion, and very much transcending the
other senses, should be thought worthy to receive the splendor
and illumination of the celestial bodies, but that the other
senses should not be adapted for this purpose. Of these, however,
and such like particulars, if any one can assign more probable
causes, let him be considered as a friend, and not as an
enemy.&rdquo;</div>
<div class="fndef"><a class="fn" id="fn_17a">[17a]</a>The
soul has three vehicles, one etherial, another aerial, and the
third this terrestrial body. The first, which is luminous and celestial,
is connate with the essence of the soul, and in which alone it resides
in a state of bliss in the stars. In the second, it suffers the punishment
of its sins after death. And from the third it becomes an inhabitant
of earth.

</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_20" href="#fr_20">[20]</a>&ldquo;Pythagoras,&rdquo; (says Proclus in MSS. Schol. in Cratylum,)
&ldquo;being asked what was the wisest of things, said it was
number; and being asked what was the next in wisdom, said,
he who gave names to things. But by number, he obscurely
signified the intelligible order, which comprehends the multitude
of intellectual forms: for there that which is the first,
and properly number, subsists after the superessential one.<a class="fn" href="#fn_20a">[20a]</a> This
likewise supplies the measures of essence to all beings, in
which also true wisdom, and knowledge which is of itself, and
which is converted to and perfects itself, subsist. And as
there the intelligible, intellect, and intelligence, are the same,
so there also number and wisdom are the same. But by the
founder of names, he obscurely signified the soul, which indeed
subsists from intellect, and is not things themselves like
the first intellect, but possesses the images and essential transitive
reasons of them as statues of beings. Being, therefore, is
imparted to all things from intellect, which knows itself and is
replete with wisdom; but that they are denominated is from
soul, which imitates intellect. Pythagoras therefore said,
that it was not the business of any casual person to fabricate
names, but of one looking to intellect and the nature of
things.&rdquo;</div>

of the intelligible order. For number according to hyparxis or

Proclus on the Theology of Plato.

spherical; and, as Iamblichus afterwards observes, the Gods

we learn from Simplicius, pertaining to the color, figure, and
magnitude of superficies. Keissling, having no conception of

the Pythagoric theorem of 47. 1 of Euclid. For the square
described on the longest side is equal to the two squares described
on the two other sides. The longest side therefore is
said by geometricians to be equal in power to the powers of
the other sides. This however Kiessling not understanding, says,
&ldquo;that power is the space contained between the concurring
lines of figures, and is the area of the triangle.&rdquo; &ldquo;<span title="Dynamis" class="g">&Delta;&upsilon;&nu;&alpha;&mu;&iota;&sigmaf;</span>

and Stoics, among the ancients, looked to virtue as
its own reward, and performed what is right, because it is right
to do so. And though they firmly believed in the immortality
of the soul, their conduct was not at all influenced by the hope
of future reward. This great truth indeed, that virtue brings
with it its own recompense, is almost at present obsolete; and
it is no unusual thing to hear a man, when afflicted, exclaiming
with Methodistical cant,

</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_45" href="#fr_45">[45]</a>Iamblichus a little before informs us, that Pythagoras suspected
that Phalaris intended to put him to death, but at the
same time knew that he was not destined to die by Phalaris.
This being the case therefore, Pythagoras has no claim to fortitude
in this instance, in being free from the fear of death.
But he has great claim to it, when it is considered that he was
in the power of a tyrant who might have caused him to suffer
tortures worse than death.

therefore, humility was no virtue, though in modern times it is
considered to be the greatest of the virtues. With Aristotle
likewise it is no virtue; for in his Nicomachean Ethics he
says, &ldquo;that all humble men are flatterers, and all flatterers are
humble.&rdquo;

have any knowledge of philosophy: and Gale, who did, has not
corrected him in this and many other places in which he has
erred through the want of this knowledge. Gale however,

that a part of the soul different from the dianoetic is here intended

thing named, so far as it is named, i.&nbsp;e. so far as pertains to its
possession of a name. For the nominator is the cause, and the
name the effect.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_91" href="#fr_91">[91]</a>In the Latin it is &ldquo;post <i>dispositionem</i> corporis.&rdquo; But for
<i>dispositionem</i> it is evidently necessary to read <i>dissolutionem</i>.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_92" href="#fr_92">[92]</a>This is conformable to the well-known Pythagoric precept,
&ldquo;Follow God.&rdquo;
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_93" href="#fr_93">[93]</a>&ldquo;We can by no other means,&rdquo; (says Porphyry De Abstinen.
lib. I.) &ldquo;obtain the true end of a contemplative, intellectual
life than by <i>adhering</i> to God, if I may be allowed the
expression, as if fastened by a nail, at the same time being torn
away and separated from body and corporeal delights; having
procured safety from our deeds, and not from the mere attention
to words.&rdquo;
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_94" href="#fr_94">[94]</a>But intellect is the recipient of wisdom, and therefore intellect
is the true man. This also is asserted by Aristotle.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_95" href="#fr_95">[95]</a>In the Latin <i>fidelis</i>; but as Ruffinus, the Latin translator
of these sentences, frequently adulterates the true meaning of
Sextus, by substituting one word for another, I have no doubt that in this sentence the original
was<span title=" pepaideumenos" class="g"> &pi;&epsilon;&pi;&alpha;&iota;&delta;&epsilon;&upsilon;&mu;&epsilon;&nu;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span> <i>eruditus</i>,
and not <span title="pistos" class="g">&pi;&iota;&sigma;&tau;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span> <i>fidelis</i>. My reason for so thinking is, that in
one of the sentences of Demophilus it is said, &ldquo;that the life of
<i>ignorant</i> men is a disgrace,&rdquo;<span title=" t&ocirc;n amath&ocirc;n oneidos einai ton bion" class="g"> &tau;&omega;&nu; &alpha;&mu;&alpha;&theta;&omega;&nu; &omicron;&nu;&epsilon;&iota;&delta;&omicron;&sigmaf; &epsilon;&iota;&nu;&alpha;&iota; &tau;&omicron;&nu; &beta;&iota;&omicron;&nu;</span>;
and this in the sentences of Sextus is, &ldquo;Hominum <i>infidelium</i>
vita, opprobrium est.&rdquo; If, therefore, Ruffinus translates<span title=" amath&ocirc;n" class="g"> &alpha;&mu;&alpha;&theta;&omega;&nu;</span>,
<i>infidelium</i>, there is every reason to suppose that he would
translate <span title="pepaideumenos" class="g">&pi;&epsilon;&pi;&alpha;&iota;&delta;&epsilon;&upsilon;&mu;&epsilon;&nu;&omicron;&sigmaf;,</span> <i>fidelis</i>.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_96" href="#fr_96">[96]</a>Several of these sentences as published by Arcerius, are in a very defective state; but which, as the learned reader will perceive, I have endeavoured to amend in my translation of them.

it is very appropriately used as a symbol of a material nature.
